Krewe du Vieux 2018: Take a virtual tour of the route with King Richard Campanella,"This area formed the heart of the plantation of Bernard Xavier Philippe de Marigny de Mandeville, who lived in a mansion where the electrical substation now stands. Expecting that the Louisiana Purchase would spur urban expansion, Marigny had his parcel subdivided for urbanization in 1805, hiring French engineer Nicolas de Finiels to design a plat. Finiels successfully reconciled an extension of the French Quarter street grid with a sharp bend of the Mississippi River by reshaping key connector squares into polygons of various configurations, which surveyor Barthelemy Lafon then laid out in 1806. The first neighborhood downriver from the city proper, the Faubourg Marigny soon developed into a predominantly Creole community, including substantial numbers of both Free People of Color, as well as enslaved African Americans and German, Irish and other immigrant populations. A century later, these riverfront blocks hosted a variety of light industrial land uses worked by the neighborhood’s blue-collar residents. The four blocks surrounding this intersection were occupied in the early 1900s by rice mills, an ice plant, horse and mule stables, a yarn and hosiery factory and a streetcar barn; the streets themselves were paved in granite stones. Originally named Rue d’Enghein, the street was later called Lafayette and then Almonaster before finally being named Franklin. This avenue marked the lower limit of the Marigny Plantation and of the original faubourg, despite that current perception places the neighborhood’s lower border at Press Street. The area below Franklin was subdivided after 1810 as the Faubourg D’Aunoy and soon developed a similar cultural milieu as its neighbor. The imposing lavender building overlooking the Chartres/Franklin intersection was once a Methodist church, and the restaurant across the street is said to incorporate circa-1790s structural elements from the D’Aunoy plantation complex. Royal Street heading upriver: This stretch of Royal Street, formerly Rue Casa Calvo, is quintessential Faubourg Marigny. Of particular interest is 2231 Royal, a one-of-a-kind 1830s townhouse with a central carriageway and raised basement, as well as the two solid circa-1850s Greek Revival structures on either side of the Elysian Fields intersection. Royal Street was the return route of the “streetcar named Desire,” after it rolled down Bourbon and Dauphine streets to Desire Street in present-day Bywater. Electricity for the streetcar system in these lower neighborhoods came from the brick edifice at the foot of Elysian Fields, known in the early 1900s as the New Orleans Railways and Light Company Claiborne Power House. Years before the Marigny family came into possession of this land, it was owned by Claude Joseph Villars Dubreuil, a French colonial builder in constant need of lumber. In the 1740s, Dubreuil had a diversion canal excavated from the levee through the center of his parcel, to power a sawmill with the flow of river water. Dubreuil’s canal later became the Marigny Canal, and when Finiels designed his street grid in 1805, he used this pre-existing axis to serve as the subdivision’s grand avenue, giving it great width, an adjacent park (Washington Square), and a lovely name, Champs-Élysées . In 1831, Elysian Fields became the right-of-way for the track bed of the Pontchartrain Railroad, the first to complete its charter west of the Appalachians. Known locally as “Smoky Mary,” the steam line operated until 1932. Royal Street at Washington Square: Into the 1960s, the river side of this block was home to Holy Redeemer Church, a black Catholic congregation worshipping in a circa-1860 edifice originally designed as the Third Presbyterian Church by architects Albert Diettel and Henry Howard. Next door, on the corner of Frenchmen Street, was a Carnegie Library built in 1902. All this changed when Hurricane Betsy utterly destroyed the church and damaged the library. Five years later, in 1970, the cleared lot became home to the Christopher Inn, a project of the Archdiocese’s nonprofit housing agency created by Archbishop Phillip Hannan for elderly congregants. The building’s large scale and International Style have raised the ire of historicists ever since, but the apartments provide affordable downtown living for senior citizens, many of whom grew up in the neighborhood and would otherwise be unable to live here.",['Dubreuil'],[-20.3000855],[57.6023555]
Turkey shells Syrian city as it pushes into Kurdish enclave,"BEIRUT (AP) � A Kurdish militia spokesman says Turkey has shelled a city in northeastern Syria as Turkish forces press into a Syrian Kurdish enclave for the fourth straight day. Nureddine Mehmud says Turkey fired on Qamishli and other towns along the Syrian-Turkish border on Tuesday, calling it a diversion from the main campaign by Turkey and allied Syrian militia forces to invade the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, along another part of the frontier. There were no reported casualties. Mehmud says forces from the People's Protection Units, or YPG, have held the Turkish forces from making ""any real progress"" in Afrin. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Monitoring group says at 24 civilians, 24 Kurdish fighters, and 25 Turkish-backed Syrian militiamen have been killed in the clashes in Afrin since Saturday.","['Turkey', 'Syria', 'Afrin', 'Britain']","[38.9597594, 34.6401861, 36.5083795, 54.3151594]","[34.9249653, 39.0494106, 36.870089, -1.9181532]"
"A new development in Gainesville, Va., provides a taste of Charleston with a view of the Blue Ridge","Southern design Buy Photo : Exteriors are varying shades of brick; window frames are desert sand colored. “Color packages were developed strictly for this community,” Green-Karol said. “The style looks a little like the architecture in Charleston,” said Sue Barusefski, a resident since September. “They tried to bring in that Southern influence in the design.” The residences are three levels. Entrance doors are on the ground floor or lower level adjacent to the garage and lead to a clubroom that can be converted to a guest bedroom. A door opens to a brick-paved outdoor terrace and fenced back yard. Barusefski turned the lower level “into the office I always dreamed of,” she said. “There’s room for deep shelves, a big desk and a credenza. I put in a dry bar where I put my Keurig and a beverage fridge. This has definitely made it a place you can stay till you’re finished with what you’re doing.” The Garays, who have six grandchildren, use the lower level as a rec room. Only one has visited so far, Beth Garay said, but “I can assure you they’ll have lots of space to run around when they come.” Four floor plans — Jamison, Norbury, Granville and Somerville — are offered. The main differences are an option of an elevator and a transitional or contemporary kitchen. All plans offer at least one veranda, which is a covered porch with DuraDeck flooring. In the Jamison model, the kitchen and family room are on one end of the house and dining and living rooms are on the other end. In the Norbury model, the kitchen is centered between the family and breakfast rooms and the dining and living rooms. A 10-foot-long island dominates that kitchen. Three bedrooms, each with a bathroom, occupy the top floor. The owner’s suite walk-in closet is reached through the bathroom. The Norbury has a stand-alone tub. Community amenities : It is a gated community with 24-hour monitoring. Lake Manassas is a 770-acre public reservoir. “It’s a beautiful setting for the homes, and you can take an uplifting walk around the lake, though you can’t swim in the water,” said Barusefski. Residents can use a clubhouse, pool, tennis courts, multipurpose fields, playground and miles of trails. Robert Trent Jones Golf Club is a private membership club; Stonewall Golf Club is public. Shopping : The Shops at Stonewall offer Wegmans and Bed Bath & Beyond; Virginia Gateway offers Giant Food, Target and Best Buy; Haymarket Village Center houses Walmart and Kohl’s. Schools : Buckland Elementary, Ronald Wilson Reagan Middle, Patriot High. Transit : Turtle Point is a drive-in-and-out community, but residents can walk to Wegmans. “It makes me feel sometimes like we have a personal chef there,” said Barusefski.

Laura Ingraham takes an Easter break amid David Hogg controversy and advertiser revolt,"Cleve R. Wootson Jr., The Washington Post March 31, 2018 2:36 pm. A few moments before wheels up on Laura Ingraham’s Easter vacation Saturday morning, she tweeted a preflight picture of a holiday-themed drawing made by one of her sons. It had all the Easter trappings: parishioners at an altar, a communion service complete with a chalice, a haloed figure flanked by angels, watching from above. “My seat-mate son drew me an Easter present preflight,” her accompanying tweet said. Ingraham told her Fox News show viewers on Friday that the trip is an Easter vacation. The network told The Washington Post the vacation was pre-planned. But the break comes as she is facing some of the harshest criticism so far on her five-month-old Fox News show – and a growing advertiser revolt around comments she made about David Hogg, a survivor of the , and activist. school shooting in Parkland, Florida The controversy revolves around her treatment of Hogg, one of the survivors of the shooting in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Over the past few months, Hogg has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates for stronger gun laws. But amid the rallies and talk shows and a ballooning number of Twitter followers, he is also a high school senior who felt sad after getting a college rejection letter. In an interview with TMZ on Tuesday, Hogg spoke about receiving rejection letters from California colleges. Hogg has an SAT score of 1270 and a 4.2 grade-point average. He’s been accepted to Florida Atlantic University, California Polytechnic State University and California State University at San Marcos, TMZ reported. On Wednesday morning, Ingraham tweeted a story from a conservative news site that described Hogg as a “Gun Rights Provocateur” – and said he hadn’t gotten into four University of California schools he applied to. “David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it,” Ingraham tweeted. “(Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA . . . totally predictable given acceptance rates.)” Hogg responded by compiling a list of 12 companies that advertise on Fox News’s “The Ingraham Angle” and sent a message to his nearly 700,000 Twitter followers: “Pick a number 1-12 contact the company next to that #” Many did. Shannon Watts tweeted “If you’re going to promote values, @Gillette, then you should stop being one of the main advertisers for Laura Ingraham’s show.” Blackbird Writes! tweeted “@AllstateYour advertising on #IngrahamAngleis associating your respectable brand with Laura Ingraham, who traffics in lies, bigotry and hatred. Consider me to never be your customer. @davidhogg111#boycottAllstate#BoycottIngramAdverts” More than a dozen advertisers have announced that they were pulling commercials from Ingraham’s show, according to ThinkProgress. They included Johnson & Johnson, Nestlé, Hulu, Jos. A. Bank, Jenny Craig, Ruby Tuesday and Miracle-Ear. Ingraham apologized, but Hogg blasted it as an insincere “effort just to save your advertisers.” The advertisers’ efforts to distance themselves demonstrate the influence the Parkland students have amassed and companies fears’ about becoming collateral damage in polarizing controversies. As The Washington Post’s Amy B Wang, Allyson Chiu and Tracy Jane reported: “The swift results showcase the power that the Parkland survivors have, not just in organizing rallies but in spurring corporate America to act. Brands, too, have become quicker to distance themselves from controversy, whether by denouncing white supremacy after neo-Nazis praise their products or by pulling their sponsorship after another Fox News personality, Bill O’Reilly, was accused of sexual harassment. “Since the 2016 election, calls to boycott retailers have become frequent: The #GrabYourWallet campaign began as a way to protest Trump, and it identified companies that carried merchandise bearing the Trump name. Those calls have been met with equally passionate responses by Trump supporters who say they are determined to use their buying power to stand with the president and his family.” But Hogg and the other Parkland teens have also show a willingness to go after their detractors directly. “I just think it’s a testament to the sick immaturity and broken state of our government when these people feel the need to peddle conspiracy theories about people that were in a school shooting where 17 people died, and it just makes me sick,” Hogg told BuzzFeed News. “It’s immature, rude and inhuman for these people to destroy the people trying to prevent the death of the future of America because they won’t.” And he had some specific thoughts on Ingraham’s vacation. Around midnight Friday, he posted a video clip of Ingraham’s announcement. “Have some healthy reflections this Holy Week,” he tweeted.","['Parkland', 'Florida', 'California', 'San Marcos', 'America']","[26.3100794, 27.7567667, 36.7014631, 29.8826436, 39.7837304]","[-80.23727, -81.4639835, -118.755997, -97.9405828, -100.445882]"
Perm Secretary Launches Book for Africa’s Development,"Former Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Information Communication Technology, Abuja, Dr. Tunji Olaopa, has launched his book, Transforming the African Public Service, for the development and intervention of Nigeria and Africa as a whole. This book is much-needed and timely intervention in the plethora of possible initiatives that are vital for development in Africa. The reviewer, Professor Toyin Falola said. The writer offers readers several constructive pathways to dissect the problems of development, as well as more organic means for sustaining improvement in the civil service beyond clichéd, recycled ideas and nostrums. Indeed, Olaopa’s book expounds the underlying structures, the ideological base, and the conceptual foundations on which the superstructure of the modern African project is being constructed in order to understand if the existing engine of government can support the dreams of Africa’s future or, in fact, impair them. The author clarifies that modernising the African public service requires, first, a critical investigation of its history. “Sufficient knowledge of the historical and social composition of the civil service empowers us to re-order the patterns of social behavior and political routines that can impel the process and habits of sustainable development”, the reviewer said. He added: “I have known Dr. Olaopa for a number of years in his capacity as a political theorist-cum-scientist, serious intellectual, career civil servant and consultant. He is a passionate Nigerian who is entirely committed to the production of the knowledge and insights that can galvanize growth and progress in Africa.” Falola described the author as a perceptive thinker, writer, and regular op-ed contributor in the Nigeria and international media fora. “Dr. Olaopa’s devotion to the project of building a modern Africa shines through every page of this book. In this collection, he profoundly interrogates the imperative of African development from an angle that tends to be overlooked when policy makers and pundits debate the optimistic facts and figures that serve as indices for gauging the future of the continent, namely, the civil service.” Now, he expressed further that at several crucial junctures in Africa’s history, from pre-colonial, colonial to postcolonial, and through the different phases of modernity and globalisation that “our culture has witnessed, Africa did not adequately establish the conditions of its socio-political processes of transition”, he said. According to him, the lack of an agenda for reforming the administrative structure of the inherited government to make it relevant to “our” social and historical processes has, consequently, seen African governmental systems perennially saddled by an administrative workforce trapped in the limbo of an undefined temporality. As mediators of the gulf between those who govern and those who are governed, the civil servants who are supposed to carry out administrative activities that facilitate development and communication activities have, in fact, contributed to widening the chasm between the parties with deleterious effects on the polity. Falola had said. Through the various phases of political instability Africa has faced, the reviewer told the audience that the civil service had been the administrative arm of the execution of insidious agendas. This legacy, one notes, still resonates through post-military and emerging democracies in Africa. Redressing the persistent problems warrants a radical rethinking that conjoins a philosophical analysis of our social history with tested and practical knowledge. Dr. Olaopa successfully mobilizes both to confront the procedural logjam and administrative disconnect in African civil service and the ways they have impeded democratic and civic initiatives. His work of critical intervention finds the inextricable and fundamental links between the activities of the civil service and the superstructure of Africa’s development. The Prof. says Olaopa’s skillfully marshals his scholarly interventions over the years, his professional experience, and his intellectual excellence to forge the new thinking and strategic approaches necessary to recreate the civil service in Africa. Hence, he concludes that the book, Transforming the African Public Service, is, therefore, a treasure trove for Africans, Africanists, scholars, citizens, policymakers, reformists, and everyone else seeking an understanding of the foundational paths to activating and maintaining the course of institutional flourishing in Africa.","['Abuja', 'Nigeria', 'Olaopa']","[9.0643305, 9.6000359, None]","[7.4892974, 7.9999721, None]"
Putin’s spokesman likens Weinstein accusers to prostitutes,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, dismissing accusations that a Russian legislator had sexually harassed female journalists, asked why the women stayed quiet all these months, arguing that similar complaints against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were made by actresses who were effectively “prostitutes.” Dmitry Peskov says “they earned hundreds of millions of dollars, and after 10 years they say that Weinstein is bad,” according to Russia's Sputnik news service. He says “none of them went to the police, did not say ‘Weinstein raped me.’.. No! (they) wanted to earn $10 million.” “What’s the name of a woman who slept with a man for $10 million?"" he added. ""Maybe, I’m speaking crudely, she’s called a prostitute.” Pskov made his comments on a talk show hosted by the Russian Higher School of Economics, saying he was speaking personally and not on behalf of the Kremlin. He was addressing a sex scandal involving Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the foreign relations committee in Russia’s lower house of parliament. Slutsky was accused of sexual harassment by Dozhd (Rain) TV channel producer Daria Zhuk and BBC Russian Service correspondent Farida Rustamova, who filed complaints to the parliamentary ethics committee. ""If Slutsky assaulted this poor journalist where was she all this time? If he harassed you, why did you keep quiet? Why didn’t you go to the police? Why, after so much time has passed, did you go to the ethics committee instead,"" Peskov asked. The Russian independent trade Union of journalists wrote an open letter to the Duma calling for a condemnation of Slutsky after the ethics committee committee dismissed the accusations as unfounded. That in turn prompted several Russian news outlets, including Dozhd, RTVI, RBC, Kommersant, and Novaya Gazeta, to withdraw their journalists from any dealings with the legislator,","['Hollywood', 'Russia']","[34.0980031, 64.6863136]","[-118.329523, 97.7453061]"
News and notes from the NCAA women's Final Four,"Notre Dame's Arike Ogunbowale celebrates after making the game-winning basket during overtime against Connecticut in the semifinals of the women's NCAA Final Four college basketball tournament, Friday, March 30, 2018, in Columbus, Ohio. Notre Dame won 91-89. (AP Photo/Ron Schwane) COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — So how do they top that? The two national women’s semifinal games Friday night were packed with drama, lead-changes, emotion and huge shots that sent the games into overtime. Mississippi State’s Roshunda Johnson hit the tying 3-pointer with seven seconds left to take the first game into overtime. The Bulldogs then outlasted Louisville in OT to earn their second national title game berth in as many years. The second game saw perennial power UConn claw back time after time as the game wound down, only to lose it when Notre Dame’s Arike Ogunbowale’s hit a jumper from the corner with 1 second left. “I didn’t know it was going in, but it felt good,” Ogunbowale said. Whew! “Unbelievable,” Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. “First time we’ve ever had two overtime games in the Final Four. I think just great basketball. Both games, hard fought battles and exciting for the fans.” The Irish — left with just seven scholarship players due to injuries — advance to their sixth national championship game and fifth in the last eight years. They were national champions in 2001. “I think the coaches really prepared us for the moment,” Notre Dame star Jackie Young said. “They didn’t let us get all hyped up whenever we had a lead. I think we were able to keep our composure and just get the job done.” Most of the Mississippi State team ended up in Victoria Vivians’ hotel room watching the rowdy end of the Notre Dame-UConn game. “It was pretty phenomenal,” said Vivians, an All-American guard who had 25 points against Louisville. “And I feel like tomorrow you have two great teams playing again. They both played in overtime last night, and we both know what to expect. I feel like it’s going to be a great game to watch.” KOBE IN THE HOUSE: Kobe Bryant was there Friday night to watch the UConn women but spread a little love to admirers. Vivians was bold enough to ask for “I was very excited,” she said Saturday. “I just walked up and said, ‘can I take a picture?’ He said good game, and when he said that I almost passed out. He was actually watching me out there! It was amazing.” Bryant even after her game-winning shot. tweeted at Ogunbowale “Big time shot Arike! We are a @UConnWBB family but we love seeing great players making great plays,” Bryant tweeted. Ogunbowale tweeted back: “Wow, my life is complete.” But Bryant wasn’t done yet: “Nah… it’s complete by finishing the job on Sunday.” The NBA great later followed Ogunbowale on Twitter. BIG VS. REALLY BIG: Teaira McCowan is Notre Dame’s problem now. Mississippi State’s 6-foot-7 center continued her NCAA Tournament dominance on Friday, scoring 21 points and grabbing 25 rebounds against Louisville. When she got her 24th of the game, McCowan broke the rebounding mark set by Charlotte Smith of North Carolina in 1994. She posted just the third 20-20 game in women’s Final Four history. Her 92 rebounds are the most ever in a single tournament. Notre Dame’s Jessica Shepard (6-foot-4) and Kathryn Westbeld (6-foot-2) will be charged with trying to keep McCowan in check on Sunday. “She is a force inside, a tremendous player,” McGraw said. “Works the boards like nobody I’ve ever seen. She’s a tremendous rebounder, a phenomenal player inside. She’s so dominant. We haven’t faced anybody like that.” TIP-INS: The Irish need 85 points in the championship game to tie the all-time record for most points in an NCAA Tournament.

Young’s 32 points were the most by a Notre Dame player in a Final Four game. … Mississippi State is the seventh program to play for back-to-back NCAA title games. … Mississippi State started the game against Louisville 0 for 10, then made 25 of its final 52 shots.

Barr cites conspiracy theory in support of Trump Actress Roseanne Barr threw Twitter off the rails late Friday after she tweeted her support of a right-wing conspiracy theory.,"Actress Roseanne Barr threw Twitter off the rails late Friday after she tweeted her support of a right-wing conspiracy theory. ""President Trump has freed so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world. Hundreds each month. He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that. I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,"" she tweeted. The theory, known as ""The Storm,"" is believed to have started after Trump cryptically remarked during a photo op with military leaders and their spouses before a White House dinner last October that reporters were seeing the ""calm before the storm.""

In November, Barr tweeted, ""Who is Q?"" The Daily Beast reported. The actress added hours later, ""tell Qanon to DM me in the nexxt 24 hours."" After her tweet Friday, many Twitter users took to the platform to proclaim their confusion, including New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, who simply tweeted ""What?"" Barr re-entered the spotlight this week after Trump revealed that he called to congratulate her on the highly successful reboot of the show, ""Roseanne,"" an ABC sitcom about a blue-collar family in Illinois originally broadcast in the late 1980s and 1990s. Barr, who is a supporter of Trump in the new series and in real life, has recently embraced several fringe conspiracy theories, according to The Daily Beast , including the one she tweeted about Friday, which is part of a larger conspiracy theory that alleges satanism and sex-trafficking by Trump's opponents.

During the Easter Vigil Mass on Holy Saturday, March 31, at the Manila Cathedral, Cardinal Tagle recounted the story in the Bible when, after Jesus' death on the cross, Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany, and Salome went to his tomb to anoint his body. When they arrived, they found Jesus' tomb unguarded, and the stone rolled away. ""The dead is no longer there. God has allowed the living to come out of the tomb,"" Tagle said. ( Cardinal Tagle then mentioned the ""stones"" that Filipinos should ""roll away"" to live a good, faithful life. Mga kapatid, iyong bato ng kayabangan, alisin na para makalabas ang buhay ng kapagkumbabaan ,"" Tagle said. (Brothers and sisters, the stone of pride, roll it away to let the life of humility come out.) Iyong bato ng greed o pagkaganid, alisin na nang makalabas na ang tunay na buhay ng sharing o pagbabahagi."" (The stone of greed, roll it away to let the real life of sharing come out.) Iyong bato ng walang paggalang sa kapwa, alisin na para makalabas ang buhay ng pagdadamayan."" (The stone of being disrespectful, roll it away to let the life of helping each other come out.) Iyong bato ng pagmamataas at pagtapak sa kapwa, alisin na nang makalabas ang bagong buhay ng pagmamahalan."" (The stone of being arrogant and stepping on people, roll it away to let the new life of love come out.) ""Iyong bato ng hinanakit at paghihiganti, iurong na para makalabas na ang bagong buhay ng pagpapatawad."" (The stone of resentment and revenge, roll it away to let the new life of forgiveness come out.) Fearing an apparent resurgence of a ""cold war"" in international relations, Cardinal Tagle also urged people to let out ""global warming"" – that is, the warmth of love and communion. If a person finds it hard to ""roll away"" these big stones, or if he or she wonders who can roll it down, Tagle said God ""will roll the stone not to hurt us, but to let the life of Christ come out and be our life."" ""Jesus is coming out of the tomb. Do not block his way. Go, meet him,"" added Tagle. ""He is our life, He is our light. Do not be afraid. He is the rock of our salvation, and we do not need other rocks to block His coming."" Tagle ended his sermon with a question to the faithful: "" Ano ang bato na kailangan kong ipaurong sa Diyos para makalabas ang buhay ni Kristo, maging buhay ko si Kristo?"" (What stone should I let God roll away to let the life of Christ come out, so that Christ can be my life?) , seen as the longest Mass of the year, is held on Holy Saturday to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. The Paschal candle is lit at the start of the vigil, and Catholics may opt to be baptized during the vigil. – Rappler.com.","['Manila', 'MANILA', 'Philippines', 'pagkaganid', 'Kristo']","[14.5906346, 14.5906346, 12.7503486, None, 49.1943076]","[120.9799964, 120.9799964, 122.7312101, None, -0.5798557]"
"Air France, easyJet, IAG, Lufthansa and Ryanair join forces","The CEOs of Europe’s five largest airline groups – Air France KLM, easyJet, International Airlines Group, Lufthansa Group and Ryanair – met collectively for the first time on June 17, 2015 and agreed to work together to lobby for the development of a new EU Aviation Strategy that will support growth and jobs across Europe, strengthen the sector and give Europe’s passengers lower fares and more choice. The meeting took place (in Brussels, Belgium) in response to the new EU Transport Commissioner, Violeta Bulc’s consultation on a new EU Aviation Strategy. The five agreed a vision for this strategy that would match the revolution in aviation that the liberalisation of Europe’s airline sector created a generation ago, through the creation of the internal aviation market. The five airlines identified four measures that would support the Commission‘s objectives of enhancing the competitiveness of the European air transport industry both at European and international level, supporting growth and jobs across Europe and which would help consumers through the provision of more flights and lower fares. These measures are: – The development of an EU Aviation strategy with a plan for a simple efficient regulatory structure, which would strengthen the competitiveness of European airlines, ensure jobs and growth through innovation (e.g. Horizon 2020), protect consumer interests and promote more efficiency to reduce costs. – Lowering the cost of the EU’s airports by ensuring that monopoly airports are effectively regulated; ensuring that passengers receive the full benefit of the commercial revenues which they create at airports; and that security charges are efficient. This could be achieved by reforming the Airport Charges Directive. – Delivering reliable and efficient airspace by reducing the cost of ATC provision; ensuring that ATC strikes do not cause disruption to passengers across Europe; resetting the Single European Sky strategy by focusing on using new technology to make efficiency savings; and using SESAR funding to drive compliance with the Single Sky framework. – Stimulating more economic activity and jobs by creating the right regulatory environment, removing passenger taxes and unreasonable environmental taxes. The five CEOs – Alexandre de Juniac (Air France KLM), Carolyn McCall (easyJet), Willie Walsh (International Airlines Group), Carsten Spohr (Lufthansa) and Michael O’Leary (Ryanair) – outlined their vision: “Europe’s airlines form the most competitive sector in aviation with a diverse mix of carriers offering competition and choice to consumers. This is the first time we have set aside our competitive battles to highlight the importance of a new European Aviation Strategy. “The liberalisation of aviation in Europe in the 1990’s, creating a fully liberalised single market with a comprehensive common regulatory framework 18 years ago, strongly enhanced competition across Europe. As a result, consumers have benefited with substantially lower fares and more routes across Europe and to the rest of the world. At the same time, EU airlines have maintained leading safety standards. The range and quality of services have increased and airline costs have fallen by one to two per cent per year for the last two decades. “We believe that this decline should now be matched by a reduction in those costs which airlines do not control themselves. “As the new Transport Commissioner prepares a new Aviation Strategy for Europe she must drive more competition, encourage more efficiency and help reduce costs in other parts of our industry (such as monopoly airports and Air Traffic Control providers) and reduce the tax burden on passengers.” Aviation is a proven driver of economic growth and jobs. The proposed measures will create many hundreds of thousands of jobs – particularly for young people, at a time of high youth unemployment in countries such as Cyprus, Greece Italy or Spain – and increase Europe’s GDP. The group will write to the EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc asking for these measures to be put in place. Alongside the proposed policy positions the five CEO’s confirmed their support for several key principles and action items which should underpin EU aviation policy. The most important of these is the commitment to safety and ensuring that safety standards are developed based on a risk based scientific assessment. The CEOs confirmed their support for the liberalisation of the whole aviation value chain and for pro-competition policy and regulation within the EU. They also confirmed their opposition to the provision of state-aid, as a general principle, to airlines and airports. They agreed that EU and national regulation and policies should support the efficient delivery of services, and that this includes the need for efficient operations to minimise the environmental impact of aviation. The importance of balanced consumer rights was also underlined; EU and national policies need to ensure that consumer rights are respected. The CEOs agreed to work together to encourage the Commission and EU member states to take up the proposed measures. The five airlines agreed that airline representation in Brussels today is not as effective as it could be – with six airline representative organisations – and agreed to explore possible forms of future representation. The five airlines between them carried a total of 420 million passengers in 2014, accounting for half of the passenger journeys in Europe.","['Brussels', 'Belgium', 'Cyprus', 'Greece', 'Italy', 'Spain']","[50.8465573, 50.6402809, 34.9823018, 38.9953683, 42.6384261, 39.3260685]","[4.351697, 4.6667145, 33.1451285, 21.9877132, 12.674297, -4.8379791]"
"Story Course: A chef's life, in six dishes","Chef Jae Jung has worked in some of America's greatest restaurants, from August in New Orleans to Le Bernardin in New York. She recently participated in a dining experiment called Story Course where she prepared a meal that was, literally, a lifetime in the making. Her story, dubbed ""How Do You Hug a Tiger,"" tells chef Jae's journey, against her mother's wishes, from South Korea to America to become a chef. ""She's a very strong, intense person. ... Korean moms are pretty tiger moms but she's a super tiger mom,"" Jae told CBS News contributor Jamie Wax. Each chapter is revealed through diners reading from a script, which is followed by a course. ""Chapter One: Rooftop Sauce"" was inspired by the chili sauce Jae would watch her mother make morning and night on the rooftop of their apartment. Story Course was conceived after Adam Kantor, who's currently on Broadway in ""The Band's Visit"" and Brian Bordainick, whose Dinner Lab experiment put diners in direct contact with up-and-coming chefs, were introduced by a mutual friend. ""We were actually fortunate enough to host a Passover Seder that was really interactive,"" Bordainick said. ""And it was through this telling this story of Exodus, this migration story and looking at ways to bring it to life."" ""We're living in New York City. It's a city that's built with amazing immigrant chefs from all over the world and they're often cooking somebody else's vision, someone else's story. So we were thinking about how can we excavate those stories and allow for a beautiful, delicious, six-course meal,"" Kantor explained. For their first character they settled on chef Jae, who first met Bordainick when they were both living in New Orleans. Bordainick said while he had known Jae for more than five years, it wasn't until Kantor started interviewing him did he feel he knew her on a ""different level."" ""I mean we just spent hours and hours on my couch just really digging into her story and on a deep level. She really went to some vulnerable places,"" Kantor said. ""Chapter Three: Yearning Beyond"" explains how Jae's mother wanted more for her daughter than life in the kitchen. ""Chapter Four: The Slap"" reenacts the dramatic moment when Jae tells her mom she'd been accepted to the Culinary Institute of America and was slapped in the face. In the fourth course diners are asked to slap a cracker over an egg with a spoon. The creators of Story Course feel it's crucial that the food, theatrical elements aside, maintains its excellence. ""We were really trying to make sure that the performative elements and the culinary elements worked in service of each other,"" Bordainick said. After a musical number chef Jae appeared to explain that while she never got a hug from her mom before leaving for America, her mom did send $20,000 Jae desperately needed to stay in school and fulfill her dream. Over the course of eight meals about 40 diners a night have been forking over $175 for a seat at the table and proving there is a hunger for this type of dinner theater. ""I mean obviously our world is becoming more and more technological. We are glued to our phones. We're becoming isolated in so many ways so an experience around food that brings people together I think is essential today,"" Kantor said. Kantor and Bordainick are currently working on their next Story Course with chef Behzad Jamshidi chronicling his parents dramatic escape from the shah in Iran.","['America', 'New Orleans', 'New York', 'South Korea', 'Exodus', 'New York City', 'Iran']","[39.7837304, 29.9759983, 40.7127281, 36.638392, 7.0728844, 40.7127281, 32.6475314]","[-100.445882, -90.0782127, -74.0060152, 127.6961188, 125.6000305, -74.0060152, 54.5643516]"
"Charles Barkley lashes out at NCAA, FBI and politics at Final Four","SAN ANTONIO Turner Sports/CBS analyst Charles Barkley blasted the FBI’s ongoing investigation into college basketball’s illegal recruiting world Friday at the Final Four, saying the nation’s federal law enforcement agency should be focusing on more important matters in the country. The FBI went public with an investigation in the fall, indicting several universities’ basketball programs and leading to the dismissal of former Louisville coach Rick Pitino. In February, a Yahoo Sports report detailed a number of allegations involving former and current NCAA players, while ESPN reported shortly thereafter that Arizona coach Sean Miller was caught on a federal wiretap discussing a payment for future NBA lottery pick Deandre Ayton to play for the Wildcats. “I’m still trying to figure out why the FBI is involved,” Barkley said. “Listen, I went to college in 1981. We cheated back then. We’re cheating now. They’re always cheating. The toothpaste is out of the tube. They said they gave that kid at Arizona (Ayton) $100,000. He was underpaid. There must’ve been closed bidding because I would’ve gave his (expletive) more. “I didn’t realize the FBI needed to be paying attention to college basketball. Maybe if they were paying more attention (to other matters) they wouldn’t have screwed up our (presidential election).” Barkley has previously expressed disdain for the 2016 presidential election and President Donald Trump. On Friday, he said politicians have their priorities seriously mixed up. “These (political) parties suck. Plain and simple,” Barkley said. “The Democrats have been taking my votes and black people’s votes for granted for 100 years. Republicans do what they do they’re gonna take care of rich people. We as democrats have to start calling our party out more. “If you look at neighborhoods, if you look at our schools, they suck. We’re getting left behind. The gap between the rich and the poor is getting wider. We have to start holding our politicians (more) accountable. These (politicians) are sitting here worrying about Russia and Stormy Daniels.

Godolphin's Thunder Snow wins $10m Dubai World Cup,"Dubai may have been hot and humid over the past week but thunder and snow rained on the city on Saturday night. And the royal blue silks, the colours of Godolphin, hung over the spectacular Meydan Racecourse as Thunder Snow won the 23 rd renewal of the $10 million Dubai World Cup.

The four-year-old bay colt from Helmet, the mount of Christophe Soumillon, ended Emirati handler Saeed bin Suroor's two-year drought, in sensational style, winning the 10-furlong affair by a comprehensive five-and-three-quarter of a length over strong favourite, the USA's West Coast. Thunder Snow aced the five-horse American challenge to win in record time, putting Arrogate's 2:02:53 seconds to shade with a time of 2:01:38 seconds. It was Thunder Snow's seventh win in 18 starts but the biggest Group 1 victory of his fledging career. The win also increased Saeed bin Suroor's tally to an astonishing record eight at the Dubai World Cup, the most by any trainer. Thunder Snow's victory also brought up Suroor's 38 th win after Benbatl had triumphed in the Dubai Turf earlier on the night. And while Thunder Snow, Godolphin and Saeed bin Suroor all racked up the numbers, it was a life-long dream becoming a reality for Christophe Soumillon. The Belgian jockey notched his first Dubai World Cup in nine attempts. The 36-year-old's best result was the runner-up finish to California Chrome, on board Mubtaahij. Thunder Snow was drawn on an unfavourable Gate 10, right on the outside, but that didn't deter him as it was to be his night. Thunder Snow was out of the gates in a blink of an eye and with North America, his UAE rival, with whom he tussled in the Al Maktoum Challenge, missing the start, it made it all the more easier. But it was just one contender down and many more to go as the Americans lurked. Thunder Snow still had a job to do and he did it in some style. He kept West Coast, with whom he had exchanged the lead briefly at the start, at bay over the course of the 2000-metre contest. And Thunder Snow then went on to deny American legendary trainer Bob Baffert a second win on the trot and a fourth at the World Cup. ""We won two years in a row and now we have come back and won it again. It is a great and a brilliant result,"" an elated Saeed bin Suroor said, moments after the race. ""The jockey did a great job despite being drawn from Gate 10. What he has done, nobody has done. To take Thunder Snow from the Gate 10 and to take him to a position from where he can win is superb,"" added the Emirati, whose last win came with Prince Bishop, ridden by William Buick. Meanwhile, Soumillon revealed that a pre-race pep talk helped him win. ""I don't know if it was Sheikh Mohammed's daughter, a little girl, she told me: 'It is small track and if you go in front then, you are going to win it.' I never thought I can do that running with that draw. He jumped quite well and I saw nobody trying to challenge me and then West Coast let me go. And when I arrived at the first corner, my horse was in front and, on the back straight, I was just cantering. He is a very funny horse and very talented but when he doesn't want to do, he doesn't and when he wants, it is just amazing. He was in great shape and pretty fit. He has shown that in Europe and last year in Kentucky. ""It is difficult to say how I'm feeling because it has not sunk in. I had finished second one time but winning this was like a dream come true,"" said Soumillon.

Syria says has regained most of Ghouta,"The Syrian army command says it has regained most of the towns and villages in eastern Ghouta and is pressing its military operations in the last rebel bastion of Douma. In a televised statement on Saturday, the Syrian army spokesman said the weeks-long military campaign had now brought security to the Syrian capital Damascus and also secured its main links to other parts of the country, stretching north and all the way to the Iraqi border to the east. The army command said military operations were continuing in the outskirts of the city of Douma, controlled by the Jaish al-Islam rebel group, the last patch of eastern Ghouta still held by insurgents. Douma's fall would seal the rebels' worst defeat since 2016, driving them from their last big stronghold near the capital, and would also carry potent symbolism. The town was the main centre of street protests in the Damascus suburbs against President Bashar al-Assad's rule that ignited the conflict seven years ago. The army said hundreds of rebels had been killed in the ferocious offensive. The opposition says a relentless air campaign was waged in which where the army used napalm, chlorine and incendiary bombs to demoralise rebels by targeting civilian areas. The rebels say the indiscriminate bombing forced them to capitulate and agree to surrender deals that force them either to make peace or leave for rebel held areas after weeks of bombing and sieges that prevented food from reaching the enclaves. The Syrian army has repeatedly said regaining control over rebel-held suburbs would stop rocket attacks on the capital. They deny that many civilians were killed in bombardments that rescuers and residents say reduced whole neighbourhoods to rubble in densely populated areas where at least 350,000 people lived. Defence analysts say a major goal of the campaign was to complete a security belt around the capital. President Assad said recently securing eastern Ghouta had foiled plots by his foreign enemies to topple him. ""The gains have been achieved after units of the army eliminated hundreds of terrorists, their headquarter and their fortifications,"" the army statement said. Douma is surrounded by government forces. Tens of thousands of civilians remain in the town. The rebels there deny they are negotiating an evacuation deal and say talks with the Russian military aim to find a solution that would allow them to stay in the city under Moscow's protection. The Russian-backed offensive in eastern Ghouta has killed more than 1600 civilians and wounded thousands, rescuers said. The authorities say about 150,000 people have now been displaced from the region. Thousands of people -- fighters, their families and other civilians -- have been leaving for northwestern Syria from other parts of eastern Ghouta in convoys of buses that have been given safe passage to Idlib province.","['Douma', 'Damascus', 'Moscow', 'Syria']","[33.5696629, 33.5130695, 55.7505412, 34.6401861]","[36.4012933, 36.3095814, 37.6174782, 39.0494106]"

Mississauga break-in suspects come face-to-face with camera,"Peel Regional Police are searching for two suspects in connection with a break-in in Mississauga earlier this month that had the particular misfortune of coming face-to-face with a security camera on the premises. Investigators say that on March 10, officers on patrol responded to a call for a break and enter in the area of Eglinton Avenue West and Dubonet Drive. The two suspects allegedly smashed a glass sliding door to gain entry to the home. In the video, a man in black glasses speaks in Spanish after spotting the camera pointed right at him. He then grabs the camera and unsuccessfully attempts to disable it. He asks the other suspect, who he referred to as “Carlos,” for assistance. The first suspect repeats the world “pila” several times, which means “battery” in English. The suspects allegedly went to the home’s upstairs area and took jewelry and electronics before fleeing the scene. Photos and security camera footage of both suspects was released on Saturday afternoon. Anyone with information is asked to call police at 11 Division at 905-453-2121, ext. 1133.",[],[],[]

The Latest: Russian envoys leave Washington to head home,"LONDON The Latest on the nerve agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain. (all times local): 7:50 p.m. In Washington, some of the 60 Russian diplomats being expelled from the United States in the poisoned spy dispute have been seen boarding a bus and leaving the Russian Embassy in the U.S. capital. The Russian state news agency Tass said the first group of expelled diplomats and their families left the embassy compound on Saturday to fly to Moscow. The U.S. said those expelled were intelligence agents working under diplomatic cover, including 48 from the embassy and 12 posted to Russia’s mission to the United Nations. They were given a week to leave the country. Britain says the Russian government was involved in the March 4 nerve agent poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain, a charge that Russia denies. Hundreds of diplomats are being expelled from both the West and Russia in the dispute. 7:15 p.m. Russia’s Foreign Ministry has released lists of questions that it wants Britain and France to answer in connection with the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in a British city in early March. Britain blames Russia in the case, which Russia adamantly denies. The dispute has set off sweeping expulsions of Russian diplomats from Britain and some of its allies, followed by retaliatory expulsions of their diplomats from Russia. The questions — 14 to Britain and 10 to France — concentrate on French investigators’ involvement in the poisoning probe, including asking on what basis France became involved and asking what level of expertise they had. Britain says the investigation has shown the ex-spy and his daughter were poisoned by a nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union. 6:45 p.m. Russia’s embassy in London is warning that Russians travelling to the United Kingdom could face provocations, including the insertion of foreign objects into their luggage. The warning, posted Saturday on the embassy website, said it reflected “the anti-Russian policy, the growing threatening rhetoric of the British side (and) the British government’s selective actions against Russian individuals and legal entities.” Britain accuses Russia of involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury, which Russia heatedly denies. Each country has expelled 23 of the other’s diplomats and Russia has further ordered Britain to reduce its staffing at the embassy in Moscow to the same level Russia maintains in London. Tension escalated further late Friday when British officers searched an Aeroflot passenger plane at Heathrow airport. The Russian statement said “we urge the close monitoring of personal belongings and luggage in order to avoid provocations with foreign objects being placed in them.” 2 p.m. The British government is considering Russia’s request for access to the daughter of a former Russian intelligence officer who were both poisoned in Britain by a nerve agent. The Foreign Office say Saturday it was reviewing the Russian request to meet with Yulia Skripal, a Russian citizen, “in line with our obligations under international and domestic law.” The government’s consideration will include “the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal,” it said. British Prime Minister Theresa May has blamed the Russian government for the attack on the Skripals, a charge denied by the Kremlin. May has received strong backing from the United States and her allies in Europe, which have accepted Britain’s view that the Russian government was responsible for the use of a lethal nerve agent. Russian officials insist they have a legal right to see the 33-year-old Skripal, who lived in Moscow and was visiting her father, Sergei Skripal, in Salisbury when they were attacked March 4 with a nerve agent.","['LONDON', 'Britain', 'Washington', 'the United States', 'U.S.', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'France', 'the Soviet Union', 'London', 'the United Kingdom', 'Salisbury']","[51.5074456, 54.3151594, 38.8950368, 47.8281626, 48.6840558, 55.7505412, 64.6863136, 46.603354, 44.423953, 51.5074456, 52.4577754, 51.0690613]","[-0.1277653, -1.9181532, -77.0365427, -122.598365, 9.0096574, 37.6174782, 97.7453061, 1.8883335, 34.0547074, -0.1277653, -1.8692099, -1.7954134]"
Vietnam wants Russia’s greater role in Asia-Pacific: Party chief,"Hanoi (VNA) – Vietnam always supports and wants Russia to play a greater role in the Asian-Pacific region, considering it an active element to peace and stability in the region and the world, said General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyen Phu Trong. The Party chief made the remark at a reception for visiting Minister of Defence of Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoyu in Hanoi on January 23. “The Party, State, National Assembly, Government and people of Vietnam have greatly treasured the traditional friendship and efficient cooperation with Russia and have always attached importance to developing the comprehensive strategic partnership with the country, regarding it as one of top priorities in their foreign policy,” he stated. He spoke highly of the results of the talks between Defence Ministers Ngo Xuan Lich and Sergey Shoyu, adding that “Vietnam sees Russia as a prioritized partner in cooperation in military technology based on high trust and not aiming to act against a third country, contributing to safeguarding peace, stability and sustainable development in Asia-Pacific and the world.” Close and regular cooperation between the two defence ministries has helped ratchet up the comprehensive strategic partnership of the two countries, Party chief Trong said, expressing his belief that the outcomes gained during Minister Sergey Shoyu’s visit will contribute to reinforcing and deepening the partnership, especially in defence and military technology cooperation. The Russian Minister said Russia always places importance to reinforcing and developing the traditional friendship and comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam and will spare no effort to push the implementation of signed agreements, particularly on defence and military technology cooperation, to make practical changes in the bilateral ties.

TN files for contempt against Centre,"Tamil Nadu on Saturday moved the Supreme Court to initiate contempt proceedings against the Union government for its “wilful disobedience” in not implementing the court’s February 16 judgment in the Cauvery dispute. In its petition, the State said the Centre had failed to frame a scheme within the time limit set by the court, by not setting up the Cauvery Management Board and the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee to monitor the allocation of the river water among Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Puducherry. Election constraints. The contempt petition has been filed at a time when the Centre has also moved the court for a three-month extension of time to implement the verdict. The Karnataka Assembly election is to be held on May 12. While seeking clarification on some aspects of the verdict, the Centre claimed that notifying the scheme during the election process would lead to “public outrage” and “cause law and order problems.” Tamil Nadu accused the Centre of refusing to act to “protect the interests of the farmers and the larger interests of the State.” Six-week deadline. The contempt petition wants the court to “purge the contempt forthwith” by directing the Centre to frame a scheme by providing for the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) and the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee as per the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal’s order of 2007. As per the February 16 judgment in the appeals, the Centre had to frame the scheme in six weeks. The deadline ended on March 29. In its application, the Centre asked the apex court to clarify whether it was open to it to frame a scheme “at variance” with the tribunal’s recommendations. For one, it wanted to know whether a CMB can have a mixture of administrative and technical expertise rather than the purely technical body envisaged by the tribunal. Secondly, the Centre asked whether it could accord the CMB functions different from those recommended by the tribunal. Finally, the Centre asked the Supreme Court for its opinion on the framing of the scheme under Section 6A of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act of 1956, considering the divergent views expressed between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Tamil Nadu wants the CMB as per the 2007 tribunal order, while Karnataka wants a two-layer scheme, one headed by a committee led by the Union Water Resources Secretary. The Centre’s application, filed after the court closed this week, is pending. Tamil Nadu, which filed the contempt petition through advocate G. Umapathy as soon as the court registry opened on Saturday, said the apex court had clearly, in its February 16 verdict, barred any extension of time to the Centre for framing the scheme. “[The] Central Government was bound to give effect to the judgment by framing a scheme so that the authorities under the Scheme viz. Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee are put in place within six weeks… It has not taken any concrete steps in this regard,” Tamil Nadu contended. It pointed how “belatedly, after a period of three weeks, the Central Government merely convened a meeting of the Chief Secretaries of the party States on 09.03.2018. The convening of such a meeting does not in any way make any substantial progress in the matter of constitution of Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee”. Tamil Nadu said it had written to the Centre repeatedly on March 13, March 21 and March 23 for the constitution of the CMB within the time limit so that farmers do not suffer during the irrigation season commencing from June 1. “Ensuring timely release of water is apparent in the judgment itself and therefore, any delay in constituting Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee is to the prejudice to the farmers of State of Tamil Nadu… In the absence of any cogent reasons for not constituting Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee within the time frame and/ or not making any substantial steps in that directions amount to wilful disobedience of the judgment of the Supreme Court,” Tamil Nadu said.","['Karnataka', 'Kerala', 'States', 'Centre']","[14.5203896, 10.3528744, None, 4.686267]","[75.7223521, 76.5120396, None, 11.9414512]"
Wife of 'vanished' Chinese lawyer marches for answers,"Attorney Wang Quanzhang, who defended political activists and victims of land seizures, has had no contact with the outside world since he disappeared in a 2015 police sweep aimed at courtroom critics of Communist authorities. Wang has since been charged with ""subversion of state power"" but authorities have blocked lawyers from visiting him. ""Maybe something horrible happened to him in jail and that is why authorities don't want anyone to find out,"" his wife Li Wenzu told AFP. ""It's been 1,000 days. I don't know if he is alive or dead."" Li and a small group of supporters set off Wednesday on a march from Beijing to the ""No. 2 Detention Centre"" in the northeastern city of Tianjin, where officials last said he was being held. They pressed on even during a freak snowstorm and plan to reach Tianjin by next Friday. ""We want to see the president of the court. We want to see the presiding judge. It would be good if someone came out to tell us what Wang Quanzhang's case was all about. If he committed no sin, they should release him,"" she said. Li wore a black sweatshirt with the slogan ""Free Quanzhang"" and a cap embroidered with the words of the last letter Wang sent his parents. Fearing reprisal, he told them that becoming a human rights lawyer was not a ""reckless decision"" but a response to a call from within. For nearly three years, Li has made dozens of freedom of information requests to police -- which have been sent back unanswered -- and she has visited the complaints office of the Supreme People's Court in Beijing weekly to no avail. Instead of answers, she has been put under constant police surveillance. Tears streamed down her cheeks as Li talked about how their five-year-old son is afraid of the state security officers who have moved into an apartment below their home. - China's 'lies' - For several days beginning on July 9, 2015, more than 200 Chinese human rights lawyers and activists were detained or questioned in the largest clampdown on the legal profession in recent history. While the majority were released on bail, a handful -- including prominent lawyers Xie Yang and Li Heping -- were convicted of various crimes and sentenced to up to seven years in prison. Wang's case is unusual because no trial date has even been announced. He is the last person in the so-called ""709 crackdown"" to remain in legal limbo. When AFP called the Tianjin No. 2 Detention Centre on Thursday, a man who picked up said: ""You should not ask about this matter."" Frances Eve, a researcher for the charity Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said the tireless campaigning of family members of detained lawyers had drawn international attention to China's ""lies"" about its legal system. ""Li shouldn't be forced to wait years and walk miles to receive basic information about her husband's status. Wang Quanzhang should be released and reunited with his family,"" Eve said. China's ruling Communist party has repeatedly pledged to implement the ""rule of law"", but analysts say the crackdown shows the limits of that promise. The country's courts are tightly controlled by the party, with forced confessions often used as evidence and guilty verdicts delivered in more than 99.9 percent of criminal cases.","['Beijing', 'Tianjin', 'China']","[39.9057136, 39.1175488, 35.000074]","[116.3912972, 117.1913008, 104.999927]"

"China seeks WTO dispute resolution with US over steel, aluminum tariffs","China's commerce ministry said on Thursday it has initiated a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute resolution procedure over US tariffs on its import of steel and aluminum. The move follows a back and forth dispute between the two countries over free trade, that has escalated from an investigation by the United States into China's intellectual property practices to imposing tariffs on imports. The Ministry of Commerce said the US measures against its steel and aluminum were not for maintaining national security, but rather were in aid of trade protectionism. The ministry said in a statement posted on its website the US action were a ""serious violation of the non-discrimination principle of the multilateral trading system"", and violated its tariff-reduction commitments under the WTO. After the United States failed to negotiate compensation, China had to initiate the dispute settlement procedure to defend its rights and interests, the ministry said. The US Trade Representative’s office said earlier that the tariffs were put in place on national security grounds and objections were ""baseless"". WTO rules include an exemption for measures related to national security.

The JO voting reminiscence of Pan_Sinhala Era Approach,"h pattern of voting in favor of the ‘No Confidence’ against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe clearly indicated - A Pan Sinhala Move. Those 76 Parliamentarians who voted in favor of the Motion – out of them, no one were from the National Minorities. Even Kader Masthan, A Muslim from Vanni, who signed the Motion along with the Joint Opposition ‘took to his heels,’ during the time of voting. The other Muslim MPs who were in the SLFP - State Minister M.A.L.M. Hisbullah, State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie, Minister Faizer Mustapha, too failed to identify themselves voting in favor of the Motion and were absent at the time of voting. The only Tami, the Party List MP Angajan Ramanathan, too was seen found missing, at the time of voting. Even on the day before the Motion was taken up for debate and voting, it was widely reported that President Sirisena took exception to Tamils (TNA) supporting the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, reacted ‘immediately’ and has warned the UNP MPs that it would be counterproductive for them to enlist the backing of the TNA to face the no-confidence motion. The President, said it would send a 'wrong message' to the public. However, the UNP had made it clear that they would welcome the TNA's support to defeat the no-confidence motion without any hesitation. So, according to an international observer it, was a repetition of the 1936 Pan Sinhala move of the State Council era. The No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe was handed over to the Speaker by the Joint Opposition led by former President Rajapaksa on 21 March, carrying the signatures of 55 MPs, including 51 from the Joint Opposition nd four SLFP members in the Government ranks. The debate on the No Confidence motion kicked off yesterday (4th April) around 9.30 AM and went on till 9.30 PM – a twelve long hours of harangue. At the end of the debate, division was called by Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella to end the uncertainty against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, who was elected in the last Parliamentary General Elections, held on 17 August 2015, with the highest preferential votes in any election with 500,556 votes, beating Mahind Rajapaksa by a considerable margin - Rajapaksa garnering 423,529 preferential votes in that same election. Subsequently by 9.30 PM Speaker Karu Jayasuriya moved the House for a vote. Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dassanayake read out the names of 224 MPs (Speaker Jayasuriya not included), and each of them present was asked to state ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Voting started at 9.30 pm and ended around 10 pm. The no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe received 76 votes in favour and 122 votes against, while 26 MPs were absent at the time when division was taken by name. The SLFPers who voted in favor of the motion included Parliamentarians Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S. B. Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne and Sumedha Jayasena. A total of 26 MPs were absent during the time of voting. Among them were Parliamentarians Mahinda Amaraweera, Dr Sarath Amunugama, Nimal Siripala, Duminda Dissanayake, Faiszer Musthapha, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa, Piyasena Gamage, Mohan Lal Grero, Shriyani Wijewickrema, Lakshman Seneviratne, AHM Hisbulla, AHM Fowzie, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Sarathi Dushmantha, Manusha Nanayakkara, Malith Jayathilake, Arumugam Thondaman, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Angajan Ramanathan and notably Kader Masthan who signed the No-Confidence Motion. State Minister Palitha Range Bandara and Wasantha Senanayake who wre poised to support the JO motion changed their minds and voted against the Motion. UNP member, former Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who was stripped of his ministerial portfolio recently, also voted against the motion. Also EPDP Leader Douglas DEvananda MP voted Against the Motion while the the six members of the JVP voted in favor of the motion along with the Joint Opposition MPs. The minority parties led by Ministers Rauf Hakeem (SLMC), Rishad Bathiudeen (ACMC), Mano Ganesan and P Digambaram (TPA), voted against the Motion. They all belonged to UNF Group and contested the July 2015 Parliamentary General Elections in the UNP ticket, except for one. In the meantime almost all the 16 Tamil National Alliance Parliamentarians led by Leader of the Opposition R.Samanthan MP voted against the Motion. Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan noted that the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister does not reveal anything specific against the prime minister. “The true intentions of the SLPP is shrouded in an environment of prejudice based upon the bond scam. We cannot fall victim to such acts and allow ourselves to be used to achieve their political objectives,”Sampanthan said, adding that in the interest of this country they have to work together in a spirit of cooperation. “With regard to the Central Bank bond scam, consequent to investigations two persons are in custody and a warrant is issued against a third person and investigations are proceeding.no one should be spared and the rule of law should be implemented irrespective of who they are. The motion of no confidence seeks to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. Statements of actions of a general nature are thought to be used in an attempt to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. The wording of the motion and the timing of the motion are indicative of a pursuit of a political agenda through the motion rather than fixing responsibility with regard to the bond scam. The question must be raised as to why the wording is so weak lacking in any specific charge against the prime minister pertaining to the band scam per say. Why should this motion be brought now?” he asked. The Opposition leader said the wording of the NCM is too loose and too general in nature. “It could be that the Prime Minister is facing this situation because of the confidence he placed in someone who betrayed him. Where is the evidence or charge against the Prime Minister of involvement in the bond scam per say? Is the wording of the NCM so loose and so general because of the lack of specific material against the Prime Minister in regard to the bond scam? If that is so, in my submission the motion lacks credibility.” With regard to the timing of the motion, Sampanthan said that this bond scam occurred three years ago and it has been the subject of public focus for a long time and why has this NCM brought against the PM only now? However, 33 UNP legislators signed a petition soon after the vote demanding Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to sack the SLFP dissenters in the cabinet. In the meantime, Ministers among the 19 SLFP MPs who voted against Ranil Wickremesinghe grudgingly demanded that they be allowed to continue in the cabinet despite their lack of confidence in the government. The ministers include Dayasiri Jayasekara, Anura Yapa, Susil Premajayantha, John Seneviratne , Chandima Weerakkody and Dilan Perera.

In Malaysia: New hunt for flight MH370 gets under way,"A new hunt for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 using high-tech underwater drones has started, officials said Tuesday, in the latest bid to solve one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries. A ship operated by exploration firm Ocean Infinity arrived at the search area in the Indian Ocean on Monday and launched the drones, said Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation director-general Azharuddin Abdul Rahman. The vessel Seabed Constructor has arrived at the search area and commenced the search operation, "" he said in a statement. The jet disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people -- mostly from China -- on board, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. No sign of the plane was found in a 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) sea search zone and the Australian-led hunt, the largest in aviation history, was suspended in January last year. Ocean Infinity struck a deal with the Malaysian government to restart the hunt on a private basis and will only be paid if it finds the jet or its black boxes. It stands to make up to $70 million if successful. The new search zone is an area of about 25,000 square kilometres in the southern Indian Ocean, north of the former search area. The hunt will last a maximum of three months. If the company finds the Boeing 777, the amount it is paid will depend on where it was located. If it is found within the first 5,000 square kilometres, the firm will receive $20 million. The amount rises gradually to a maximum of $70 million if the jet is found outside the 25,000 square kilometre search zone. The ship conducting the hunt is a Norwegian research vessel carrying 65 crew, including two members of the Malaysian navy as the government's representatives. It is using eight autonomous drones, equipped with sonars and cameras, that will scour the waters for wreckage and can operate in depths up to 6,000 metres (20,000 feet). The families of those who were on board will be kept up to date on the hunt, authorities said. Only three confirmed fragments of MH370 have been found, all of them on western Indian Ocean shores, including a two-metre wing part known as a flaperon.","['Malaysia', 'China', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Beijing']","[4.5693754, 35.000074, 3.1516964, 39.9057136]","[102.2656823, 104.999927, 101.6942371, 116.3912972]"
Why giving SA’s chiefs more power adds to land dispossession,"Power over rural land has become more and more concentrated in the hands of local chiefs in post-apartheid SA. This is particularly so in areas earmarked for mining. I have spent more than a decade studying the multiple impacts of platinum mining on rural communities in the North West and Limpopo. The research has revealed widespread grassroots discontent, significant resistance to mining expansion and to local chiefs, and mounting exclusive group claims over the platinum-rich land. This matters because mining affects the livelihoods of millions of South Africans. That SA holds unparalleled reserves of platinum group metals reserves is well known. But platinum hasn’t been an economic saviour for the ordinary residents in the mine villages who face grim living conditions. Most are characterised by extreme poverty, severe inequalities and high unemployment. This is even though some of these communities have been recipients of substantial mining revenues. But they are controlled and distributed by local traditional authorities, known as chiefs, who have positioned themselves as custodians of rural land and mineral resources. They have done so in collusion with the state and mining companies. This is not as it should be. Distributive power over land doesn’t rest exclusively with chiefs. There are multiple layers of power that rest in different social units, families — and individuals within them. Most important, chiefs have never had powers to alienate land rights from ordinary residents. African land rights are acquired through membership to a group — a productive and social unit such as a family or clan. Once allocated, land rights were passed from one generation to the next. It is at the level of this unit that, by and large, decisions about distribution of such rights were taken in pre-colonial times. The law and chiefs. The post-1994 ANC government at first vacillated about defining and codifying the powers and status of chiefs, but it eventually passed legislation that significantly increased the powers of chiefs in rural local governance. The main piece of legislation that did this was the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act of 2003. It re-enacts traditional (""tribal"") authorities to preside over precisely the same geographic areas that were defined by the apartheid government. But there’s ambiguity around what powers the Act actually gives chiefs. It has been interpreted as giving them and their traditional councils powers over the administration and control of communal land and natural resources, economic development, health, and welfare, and to administer justice. In fact, the law doesn’t directly grant chiefs power and control over communal land and landed resources, but it’s been interpreted that way. The case of the chiefs’ control over mining revenues on the platinum belt epitomises the contradiction. Chiefs gain the upper hand. Over the past 30 years a new trend began to evolve. Local chiefs began to enter into deals with mining companies on behalf of rural communities on the platinum belt. Chiefs, as assumed custodians of communal resources, became mediators of mineral-led development and mining deals. This trend can be traced back to the Bafokeng community’s momentous court victory over mining royalties in the 1999. The Bafokeng chieftaincy secured enormous mineral royalties — ostensibly on behalf of the entire community. Such a victory ushered this rural community, which some have labelled ""the richest tribe in Africa"", into a new era of platinum revenues and corporate assets worth billions of rand. Several rural communities on platinum rich land in the North West and Limpopo provinces have followed the Bafokeng example. But these developments haven’t been without problems. The mediation and control of mining revenues by local chiefs has generated significant tensions and conflict in the villages that host vast mining operations. Lack of transparency and accountability, plus serious allegations of corruption have been leveled against chiefs. For instance, Kgosi (chief) Nyalala Pilane of the Bakgatla-ba-Kgafela community — perhaps even more than any other chief in SA — has been the subject of a litany of maladministration and corruption allegations. The combined value of the assets of the largely Setswana-speaking Bakgatla community, who reside in 32 impoverished villages scattered over the north-eastern foothills of the Pilanesburg Mountains, are estimated at R2bn. Yet the members of the community have yet to realise the benefits. Mining expansion has also produced significant resistance to Kgosi Pilane’s control over land. Groups of villagers have made strong claims over some of the mineral-rich farms, where some of the largest mining operations are situated. They assert that these farms were bought by their forefathers as private property and so never should have been designated ""tribal"" land. Many of these land disputes have been fought in the courts. So far, the chief has been able to hire top lawyers. He has successfully interdicted and pressed charges against activists who have called him to account. Resistance. The assumption that chiefs are custodians of rural land and mineral wealth — and as such can distribute and alienate land rights and sign complex mining deals on behalf of rural residents — has no pre-colonial precedent. It’s no surprise that ordinary people are resisting chiefly power over their property. It’s even more crucial to closely examine and understand the character of power over land and landed resources as rural land increasingly becomes a target for large-scale resource extraction. What needs attention is how ordinary rural residents articulate what leading land academic Ben Cousins calls the ""socially legitimate"" and historical ""processes through which power over land is conferred"" to different groups and individuals. There is an urgent need to examine how Africans historically accessed, shared, controlled, distributed and defended their rights to land. These customary processes must be used to guide the recording of land rights, consultation and compensation before mining can begin. Any attempt to legally empower the rural poor by securing their land rights should begin with a full understanding of these processes. Centralising this power in the hands of chiefs is another form of dispossession. This article first appeared in","['Limpopo', 'Setswana']","[-23.4735288, -24.6610934]","[29.3959199, 25.937086]"
We’ll resist attempts to discredit Ekweremadu – Ohaneze,"Traditional rulers under the aegis of Ohaneze Ndi-Igbo. By Christian Njoku/Jirai Amayah. Ohaneze Ndigbo, the Pan-Igbo socio-cultural group, said it would resist any attempt to discredit Deputy President of the Senate, Chief Ike Ekweremadu. President-General of the group, Chief Nnia Nwodo, in a statement on Thursday, in Enugu, said it was preposterous for the Federal Government to be carrying out unwarranted inquisition into Ekweremadu’s life. He said that the allegation that Ekweremadu, the highest ranking Igbo politician in the country, embezzled public funds without any prima facie case was inappropriate. Nwodo stated that the idea of asking the Senator to defend himself instead of his accusers showing how he fraudulently enriched himself, amounted to turning the law upside down. He observed that Ekweremadu was a revered Igbo son and had attracted a lot of development to his area without any previous accusation of embezzlement. “Sen. Ekweremadu is a revered Igbo son whose public image is very high and who has attracted a lot of development to his area; he has never occupied any public office where he was accused of embezzlement.” The president-general queried the system of investigation where one was tried for simply belonging to a political party “and is exonerated of an offence he committed for belonging to a political party or being in government’’. He cited examples of former and serving military officers who had been let off the hook either through plea bargain or for just changing from one political party to another. He also said that a former governor of Enugu State whose property was under investigation was now dining with the Head of State after dumping his former party for the ruling party. Nwodo warned that the apex Igbo group would no longer fold it arms while Igbo sons were being systematically singled out for persecution in a country they had contributed so much to build. He observed that the cautionary statement by Ekweremadu had been and was still being echoed by many prominent Nigerians and wondered why his case would be different. He said that it was such selective justice and marginalization of Ndigbo that fuelled agitations by their young ones for self-determination, adding that restructuring was a first step toward assuaging the situation.",['Igbo'],[7.5285684],[1.1261168]
Artists hope U.S. court ruling will help them defend street art,"Could a landmark compensation award by a New York court safeguard street art in the United States from development? By Carey L. Biron. WASHINGTON, April 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A landmark compensation award by a New York court has caught the attention of artists across the United States - and beyond - as signalling a new strategy for safeguarding street art from development. Judge Frederic Block awarded $6.75 million to 21 graffiti artists whose works were painted over without warning at a cluster of buildings in the city that for years had been the site of a globally known graffiti project called 5Pointz. While the size of the award - which has been appealed - grabbed attention, the ruling has broader implications for cities around the world as street art has flourished, experts said. The verdict was based on a 1990 law stipulating that artists who have been given permission to paint on buildings be allowed 90 days in which to take that artwork down. But the law protects only art of ""recognized stature"" as decided by ""art experts, the art community, or society in general"", and the federal law had never been successfully been used in the case of graffiti-type artwork. Block's decision last month followed a verdict handed down by a jury in November 2017 that found in favour of the artists. The jury determined the murals were of ""recognized stature"", said cultural heritage attorney Leila Amineddoleh. ""This is huge because it signifies the acceptance of graffiti as legitimate and protected, not just 'outsider' or 'fringe' art,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. For two decades, the property owner at 5Pointz had given the artists permission to paint the buildings' exterior walls, and tourists from around the world showed up to view their work. Eventually the owner, Gerald Wolkoff, wanted to demolish the buildings and develop the site. In 2013, according to the lawsuit, he had the artwork painted over in the middle of the night; the following year the buildings were torn down. In response, 5Pointz organizers filed a lawsuit under the 1990 federal law, the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA). Cory L. Stowers, an artist and organizer in Washington, called the white-washing ""the end of an era"" and said the recent verdict had ramifications across the board for artists as a way to protect their work. SURGE IN MURALS. Matthieu Prin of London-based BOP Consulting, which focuses on culture, said over the past 10 years cities had increasingly been recognizing street art as both a valid art form and as a tool for economic development. ""A key milestone in this shift has been the work of renowned street artist Banksy and London boroughs' efforts to protect his works from damage,"" said Prin, a city partnerships manager for the World Cities Culture Forum, a grouping of 32 cities. The rise in the use of social media, which has made it easier to share images of street art, has helped cities see the value of promoting cultural tourism around the works, particularly to millennials, he said. Stowers said increased collaboration between cities and street artists is visible in Washington, D.C., which today has more murals than ever before. The city's main murals project, which started a decade ago as a way to combat illegal graffiti, pairs aerosol artists with communities or property owners to create 10 projects a year. The idea is to cover a wall that is the frequent target of illegal ""tagging"" - spray-painting a name or logo - while also having the artist work with local youth, said Jeffrey Scott with the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities. While these opportunities help artists, weak or nonexistent policies mean their work, typically painted on the side of a building or wall, is not protected from development. ""In D.C., we've had a large problem with public murals being destroyed or covered over,"" Stowers said. And in response, he said, there was a ""shoulder shrug, because there's no real policy, no option to protect"" them. One option would be to have art created on panels rather than directly on buildings, so that they could be removed if needed. That, though, would cost more. ""We typically want to see the murals have a lifespan of several years, and there are some that have been up for many years,"" said Scott. But he acknowledged that agreements with property owners tended to be less formal than with the artists. ""Usually on a privately owned site we try to get some sort of provision of some sort of longevity whatever they can promise,"" he said. Washington is not alone: no U.S. city has a significant policy to protect the surge in public murals although many are starting to recognize the need for such policies, Stowers said.","['New York', 'the United States', 'WASHINGTON', 'Washington', 'London', 'D.C.', 'Humanities', 'U.S.']","[40.7127281, 47.8281626, 38.8950368, 38.8950368, 51.5074456, 38.8938474, -35.025919, 48.6840558]","[-74.0060152, -122.598365, -77.0365427, -77.0365427, -0.1277653, -76.9880428, 138.5724659, 9.0096574]"

Could a new EU benchmark for language learning be a catalyst for increased European cohesion and identity?,"The European Commission’s project to establish a ‘European Education Area’ by 2025 includes several proposals, one of which is putting together a benchmark for (foreign) language learning at the end of upper secondary education. As the project has fostering a sense of European identity and belonging as one of its goals, it seems natural that the improvement of language learning is a prominent element. But how exactly language learning is expected to help create and support this identity has not been specified. In terms of language learning, the tentative suggestion is that young people should become ‘independent users’ of at least one of their two languages recommended as the minimal target by the European Union. This has been referred to as the ‘mother tongue plus two’ policy. ‘Independent user’ refers to the levels B1 and B2 of the Council of Europe’s Common European Framework of Reference for Languages , and the higher level includes the ability to speak to and understand native speakers ‘without strain for either party’. Improving teaching efficacy is important, but has to be seen in the context of the amount of time needed by learners. This target is set against the fact that “one in two EU citizens can speak and understand only in their mother tongue”, and the EU project includes the aim of increasing the efficacy of language teaching and learning. It is clear enough that, if Europeans are to speak to each other, many more young people need to reach B2 level, and schools seem to be the best place to do so. Is this a realistic goal, is the first question, however. Improving teaching efficacy is important, but has to be seen in the context of the amount of time needed by learners. Time needed depends on motivation and on which languages are being learnt by which learners. Languages exist in ‘families’ and if the language to be learnt is in the same family as the learner’s mother tongue, less time is needed than for a language in a different but related family; even more time is needed for languages in unrelated families. European languages are, for the most part, in related families, but some are distant and others are close relations. To reach a benchmark will require different amounts of time in different school systems, even if other factors are equal. Will a benchmark improve European cohesion? An independent user speaking with ‘fluency and spontaneity’ can live and work with other Europeans ‒ whether native speakers or other independent users ‒ ‘without strain’ and feel comfortable as a member of a social group. The potential for social cohesion thus exists. Other factors, such as common interests, have to be present too; simply learning a language does not create identification with speakers of the language, whether native or not. In fact the direction of cause and effect is the opposite: identifying with speakers of a language is the most effective motivation and success factor in language learning. But will language learning help form a European identity? Just as there is no evidence that language learning creates identification with speakers of a language, equally there is no reason to think that language learning ‒ even with the EU ambition for citizens to speak two languages ‒ will create identification with Europe. Many language learners use their foreign language skills to express their own identities, ways of life or everyday culture. If Brexit takes place, the irony of developing a European identity through the learning of English will be lost on nobody. Interaction with others without strain and with a sense of belonging does not, in short, depend only on language ability. It depends at least as much on understanding the ways of life of others. Yet language teaching does not pay sufficient attention to learners’ cultural competence ‒ and neither does the EU. Linguistic competence is the almost exclusive focus of attention in teaching and, importantly, in assessment. Setting a benchmark for linguistic competence and its assessment is an inadequate target. Only when competence in ‘language-and-culture’ or ‘languaculture’ is made central to language teaching will language learners be able to use their languages to truly interact with other Europeans with ease, identifying with them through common interests and perhaps acquiring a European identity. And finally, there is the question of English. Although the EU mantra states that Europeans should learn ‘mother tongue plus two’, the reality is rather that young people want and are offered ‘mother tongue plus English and another language’. This does not in principle radically alter all that has been said above, were it not for Brexit. Although English will remain an official EU language as one of the languages of Ireland, it is associated above all with the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the strong status of English in the EU has been implicitly questioned by President Macron, who would like French to gain more influence in EU institutions. If Brexit takes place, the irony of developing a European identity through the learning of English will be lost on nobody. However, whatever happens in Europe will be tempered by the growing recognition that English is an international language decreasingly associated with native speakers ‒ in the UK or elsewhere ‒ and by the fact that English provides opportunity to identify not only with other Europeans but with people throughout the world, and this surely is as desirable.","['Ireland', 'the United Kingdom', 'UK']","[52.865196, 52.4577754, 54.7023545]","[-7.9794599, -1.8692099, -3.2765753]"

Beijing bans online Bible sales,"In China, the Bible is treated as a publication “for internal distribution” by government-sanctioned bodies. Business but especially political considerations are behind the move, namely the Bible’s growing appeal and the expanding size of China’s Christian population. According to some sociologists, China will have the most Christians in the world. Beijing (AsiaNews) Since 30 March, many Chinese online sales sites have stopped selling Bibles. This has generated complaints against online retailers like JD.com, Taobao, Amazon.cn and Dang Dang for removing the Scriptures from their catalogue. Many blame the Chinese government of trying to restrict its distribution. Chinese authorities have long categorised the Bible as a publication “for internal distribution”, i.e. to be sold only by government-sanctioned bodies to Catholics and Protestants. However, the Bible has been a bestseller for years, perhaps because many Chinese are on their own spiritual quest. This has favoured the circulation of authorised as well as unauthorised copies. ""We can't sell [. . .] spiritual books ... without an ISBN* code,"" a seller explained. That “can only be issued by the General Administration for Press and Publications (GAPP) under the State Council.” A few days ago, the authorities released a white paper on religion that said that more than 160 million copies of the Bible had been printed in more than 100 languages for over 100 countries and regions, including 80 million copies printed in Chinese, 11 ethnic minority languages as well as braille. Online people have been trying to make sense of the new restrictions on Bible sales. Some see them as a commercial move, to eliminate competition from private sites and force people to buy Bibles from government-sanctioned bodies. Others see it as an attempt by the government to limit the circulation of the Scriptures, in perhaps a desperate response to the growth of Christianity in the country. According to some Chinese sociologists like Fenggang Yang, the various Protestant denominations and the Catholic Church are growing so much that by 2030 China will have the largest number of Christians in the world. There is one problem though, namely most of the new Christians will belong to unregistered groups. * ISBN: International Standard Book Number.","['China', 'Beijing']","[35.000074, 39.9057136]","[104.999927, 116.3912972]"
The train as a replacement for short European flights is slow in coming,"The first direct Eurostar train to Amsterdam arrived on Wednesday.Photo: Joris van Gennip / HH. The Eurostar fast rail service between London and Amsterdam which started up on Wednesday is being seen as a major step forward in an overall plan to replace short European flights with fast rail journeys. Rail services are operated city-centre to city-centre, eliminating connections to airports and long check-in times. But price, political will and passport checks are all issues which still need to be overcome. In addition, there are glitches: it will take another two years before the return Amsterdam-London leg of the trip is made without a change of trains at Brussels. And perhaps a portent of times to come: Eurostar’s three hour, 41 minute maiden trip from London arrived at Amsterdam’s central station. six minutes late After Paris, London is the second destination where the train can compete with the plane on trips to and from Amsterdam. Both Dutch Rail chief Roger van Boxtel (second right in photo) and KLM president Pieter Elbers agree that the train is a good alternative to the plane on journeys of up to 500 kilometres. Overflow. More than 75,000 flights arrived at Schiphol from airports less than 500 kilometres away in 2017. This is a substantial number given the 500,000 flight cap currently in place at the Amsterdam airport. If even one-third of the passengers aboard these flights travelled by train instead, Schiphol would have years to grow and the overflow airport at would be unnecessary. Lelystad Last year 4.5 million passengers travelled on 40,000 flights between London and Amsterdam, according to broadcaster NOS . This more than all other short-haul flights put together. The connection to Paris is the only truly competitive rail journey at present. Some 1.4 million people travelled by air between the two cities in 2017. Although figures are unavailable, NOS said, it is probable more people travelled by train between the two capitals. Price. Price is a hurdle which must be overcome if rail journeys are to prevail in the future. The train is generally more expensive than the plane. ‘We have a real issue. Value-added tax does not apply to plane tickets, but VAT is added to train tickets,’ said Van Boxtel. ‘Airlines are also exempt from duty on the fuel needed to fly. We want fair competition between cheap flights and expensive train tickets.’ Politics. Political will is another issue. The Volkskrant pointed out at the weekend that the European Rail Traffic Management System should have been rolled out across the continent by now, making it easier to run more trains and cut the cost. In addition, countries want the maximum number of stops within their territory, which slows down trains and overall journey times. The 6.5 hour trip from Amsterdam to Berlin includes stops in Hilversum and Almelo, the paper points out. Rail does score well on the environment, with 80% less of carbon emissions than planes. An aircraft travelling from London to Amsterdam spews out 50 kilos of CO2, while the Eurostar emits only six kilos of CO2, environmental expert Hans Hilbers told the broadcaster.","['Amsterdam', 'London', 'Brussels', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Hilversum']","[52.3730796, 51.5074456, 50.8465573, 48.8588897, 52.5170365, 52.2241375]","[4.8924534, -0.1277653, 4.351697, 2.320041, 13.3888599, 5.1719396]"
Pope Francis tweets prayers for sick British baby Alfie Evans,"LONDON Pope Francis once again brought global attention to a sick British infant after he tweeted prayers for a 22-month-old boy whose life support is set to be switched off. Britain’s High Court ruled last month that the hospital caring for Alfie Evans can turn off his life support, against his parents’ wishes. Doctors at the Alder Hey Children's Hospital where Alfie is admitted in Liverpool, northern England, have said continuing it is ""unkind, unfair and inhumane."" Alfie has a rare degenerative neurological condition that has not been diagnosed, and is in a coma. His parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, wanted to take their son to the Vatican-owned Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital in Rome. Evans says Alfie's life support could be turned off as early as Friday. Pope Francis tweeted Wednesday: “It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard. I am praying for Alfie, for his family and for all who are involved.” The case echoes that of Charlie Gard, the terminally-ill British 11-month-old whose parents staged a months-long battle with the courts last year to take him to the United States for experimental treatment for mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare, incurable genetic disorder that left him with brain damage and unable to move. Charlie’s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, withdrew the challenge after latest tests revealed their son was unlikely to benefit from treatment. Charlie’s life support was turned off in July. Pope Francis tweeted his support for Gard and Yates before Charlie’s death and President Trump offered the family assistance. In Britain, disputes between families and doctors over how to treat a patient are decided by courts. In the U.S., the family makes the decision. It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard. I am praying for Alfie, for his family and for all who are involved. Pope Francis (@Pontifex) In a separate British case, Noel Conway , 68, who has terminal motor neuron disease, was earlier this year granted permission to appeal the High Court’s rejection of his wish to let a doctor prescribe him a lethal drug dose when his condition deteriorates. ""I believe it is possible to change the law so that vulnerable people can be protected whilst at the same time allowing those who are terminally ill, who are fully aware of what they're doing, to control and manage the final days of their life humanely and with dignity,"" Conway wrote in an article on the website of Dignity in Dying , a British campaign group.

Daughter of ex-spy poisoned in UK says case is somewhat disorientating,"Yulia Skripal made her first public comment on Thursday since being poisoned in Britain last month along with her ex-Russian agent father Sergei, saying the “entire episode is somewhat disorientating.” The Skripals were found slumped on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4 in a nerve agent attack that the British government has blamed on Russia, although Moscow denies any involvement. “I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily. I am grateful for the interest in me and for the many messages of goodwill that I have received,” Yulia Skripal, 33, said in a statement issued by London police. “I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you’ll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence.” She said she wanted to thank the hospital staff treating her and the people who came to her help when “when my father and I were incapacitated.” The attack left the Skripals in a critical condition, but on March 29 the hospital where they are being treated said Yulia was getting better. Hospital bosses said her father was still in a critical but stable condition in an intensive care unit. Earlier on Thursday, Russian state TV and Interfax reported that Yulia had phoned her cousin Viktoria Skripal in Russia, saying she and her father were both recovering and that she expected to leave hospital soon. “Everything is fine, everything is fixable, everyone is getting better, everyone is alive,” they quoted her as saying in the call. When asked about her father’s health, Yulia was cited by them as saying: “Everything is fine, he is resting right now, sleeping. Everyone’s health is fine, nobody has any problems that can’t be put right. I will soon be discharging myself (from hospital).” Russian state TV said it could not vouch for the authenticity of the quotes.

"City dad, sports execs engage grassroots in sports dev’t","CALAMBA CITY, Laguna Mayor Justin Marc SB. Chipeco has lauded the grassroots sports development program of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), through its Philippine Sports Institute (PSI), in partnership with the city government. Speaking during the kick off rites of the PSC-PSI grassroots sports development project on Tuesday, Chipeco also urged the sports officials and stakeholders from the city’s 54 barangays, various colleges and universities and civil society organizations to engage in fruitful collaborative partnerships. “Magtulungan po tayo at dapat tangkilikin natin ang ating mga grassroots sports programs (let us support this endeavor and promote our grassroots sports program),” Chipeco said. He assured of the city government’s fund support to sustain the grassroots development program through the initiatives of the city’s Cultural Affairs, Tourism and Sports Development Office (CATSDO). In an interview Thursday, CATSDO head Larissa Malinao said the program has embarked on its three-day consultative meeting on Grassroots Coaching Program and Sports Science Series with officials of the PSC-PSI at the city hall, and host venue for sports science at the University of Perpetual Help Dalta System Calamba campus in Barangay Paciano Rizal. Malinao added that the reorganized Sports Development Council of the city sought the support of the PSC and PSI for the city’s sports development early this year and tapped various sports stakeholders. “This is the effort of the reorganized sports development council of the city to make the program sustainable,” she said. Department of Education (DepEd) officials, barangay officials, coaches of various sports, government employees, and athletes attended the three-day sessions on April 3-5. She said as early as 2011, the Sports Development Council was formed through an Executive Order signed by then City Mayor and now Laguna 2nd District Representative Joaquin M. Chipeco. It was later reorganized by Mayor Chipeco. Malinao said the assistance of the PSC and PSI officials are highly welcomed and appreciated as this will spur the sports development in the grassroots level with professionals from government agencies that will help produce future topnotch athletes from the city. “This is an opportunity for us to develop top athletes who will also be given a chance to receive free college education out of their sports abilities and eventually become professional athletes,” Malinao said. In a related interview, PSI deputy director for grassroots sports Salvador Marlon B. Malbog IV, said the on-going activities such as the consultative meetings and sports science series are some of the programs of PSC-PSI all over the country which they are cascading to the grassroots. “Through sports science, we will be able to help coaches and trainers in improving their knowledge in sports nutrition, sports psychology, first aid, strength and conditioning, physiology and sports rehabilitation that they can share with their athletes,“ Malbog said. He added that PSC offers all these programs for free. PSC-PSI, he said, offers sports journalism trainings, which can be availed of upon request like any other trainings on coach education and mentoring. Wednesday’s activities include consultative meeting and workshops at the City Hall while parallel Sports Science and Officiating Course for Grassroots Coaching on athletics, basketball, volleyball and swimming were held at the University of Perpetual Help.

An Englishman and an Irishman: two TV tributes to Seventies light entertainers,"A man dies, and goes to heaven. When he gets there, he’s overwhelmed: the place is vast. But then an angel appears, offering help. “Are you lost?” asks the angel. “Let me show you round.” So, they go for a walk. “This is the Sikh area,” the angel tells him. “And this is where the Hindus are. Over there are the Jews, and in that corner are the Anglicans.” Finally, he lowers his voice to a whisper, and says: “And now we’ll just tip-toe past this room, which is where the Catholics are.” The man is confused: why the need for hush? “Well, they think they’re the only ones in here,” says the angel. Does this joke work for you? It does for me but then, I am in possession both of massed ranks of Catholic in-laws and a weird personal kink for Milton. Either way, though, it’s hard to imagine a comedian telling it, and a lot of other religious gags besides, nowadays – and on BBC Two on a Saturday night – for the simple reason that people might not get it (even if they did, they probably wouldn’t care enough to find it funny; laughter usually involves jeopardy). Was this why Stephen Russell’s Dave Allen biopic (9pm, 2 April), starring Aidan Gillen as the beloved but controversial Irish comedian, fell so disappointingly flat? It might have been: that, and the sticky sentimentality with which Russell depicted Allen’s childhood, all spiteful nuns and adorable-but-bad-with-money parents (his entire career was revenge for the former). Everything else was, after all, perfect in its way. Gillen, a great and singular actor, was well able to ride out the bad wigs, and when he did the monologues, glass of whisky in hand, his resemblance to Allen was striking. Conleth Hill, Gillen’s Game of Thrones colleague, put in a lovely turn as the alcoholic brother to whom Allen was devoted (Hill, I increasingly feel, should be in everything). But somehow I couldn’t connect this Allen – no, not even when Gillen ecstatically performed the famous Papal striptease – with the memories I have of my parents and step-parents clutching each other, weeping semi-hysterical tears, whenever the real thing was on screen (at the time, I was dismissive, being in thrall to Ben Elton and various other smug members of the next generation of comedians). A lot of people, younger than me or less nostalgic, must have been entirely baffled by the whole thing, if they tuned in at all. Larry Grayson, though: there’s enduringly funny. I’m not kidding. As a child, I adored him. Those unimprovable split-second glances to camera: he looked like a stoat about to swallow a field mouse. “You laughed before he said a word,” as Lionel Blair noted in ITV3’s exhaustive (and, at 90 minutes, slightly exhausting) tribute to the comedian (9pm, 1 April). Once he did open his mouth, though, timing was everything. Having got his start in working men’s clubs, Grayson understood that all most lines needed for the roof to lift was a half-second pause and a raised eyebrow. “Love the dress,” we heard him say to a woman in the audience at The Good Old Days (hard to believe, now, that until 1983 the BBC still put out an Edwardian-style music hall variety show). “It’s got Hull all over it.” After this, one of the tiny, aforementioned pauses. And then: “Did you come on a trawler?” He was never mean. People forget that when he took over from Bruce Forsyth as the presenter of The Generation Game in 1978, the ratings went up (at its peak, 20 million were watching). But while Forsyth was always edged with malice, Grayson was essentially kind; if the contestants were ninnies, the butt of his campest jokes, he was always going to be more stupid, vastly more clumsy. Such gentleness was born, perhaps, of his childhood, which involved a foster sister called Fan with whom he lived until he died, and who gave up her job and a boyfriend to bring him up; and of the presumed, though never confirmed, gayness (“It frightens my dog,” he once told Terry Wogan, protesting that he couldn’t be doing with going to bed with people). He was ever humble, sticking with Nuneaton even once he was famous; keeping salt and vinegar in the glove compartment of his Roller in case he stopped for chips on the way home.",[],[],[]

Should the government set the hotel room rents?,"Rashid Ullah Khan. Laissez-faire economic theory argues that the government intervention in the economic activities makes an inequitable allocation of resources. The sentiments of some of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, I feel, aren’t about having a better tourism policy, rather about being more welcoming. Yes, we should be hospitable, but we shouldn’t expect the businesses to sell goods cheaper to prove their hospitality. Some people say that renting out the rooms on “unjustifiable prices” makes the region less attractive. It seems logical to assume that by fixing the room rents the government of Gilgit-Baltistan either wants to make the region attractive for the or it wants to make it easier for shehri people to have a better experience in Gilgit-Baltistan. We should understand that the supply and demand justify the price charged for a good. For example, the prices of greengroceries fluctuate weekly. Ever wondered that why doesn’t the government issue the rate list for the prices of greengroceries every week? That’s because of the unpredictable fluctuations in the prices of greengroceries. Thus, if the prices of greengroceries, with a relatively smooth trend line, aren’t predictable. How can be the hotel room rents then? The rent, a hotel owner charges, depends on the demand for the hotel rooms. For example, If the demand for hotel rooms on a certain day was less then the rent would have been less, and if it was high on a subsequent day the rent would have been high. And the rent he charges is associated with a certain level of risk. If some of the rooms remain empty in the hotel for charging higher price than the market clearing price, then he loses money that otherwise he would have earned. Economists teach that higher profits attract high investments. Fixing the room rents, arguably, lessens the profits, therefore makes the investors invest less. If the reason for fixing them is to make the tourism industry of Gilgit-Baltistan attractive, then the economists would call it a government failure. Hotel room rents remain high in Gilgit-Baltistan because of the less number of hotels. Thus, they will not decrease in the future. Therefore, fixing them will not solve the issue in a more natural and acceptable way, but incentivizing the investors to invest in hotel business will.

Why a Small Alberta Oil and Gas Town is Pursuing Geothermal Power,"Like many towns across Alberta, the landscape around Hinton is a pincushion of oil wells. At the bottom of some of the deeper wells, temperatures can reach upwards of 120 degrees Celsius, and that geothermal heat could be about to spur the town on to its next energy windfall. A plan is underway to pump water up from deep underground, capture the heat it brings to the surface, then re-inject that water into the ground. The captured heat could warm a dozen municipal buildings or even eventually provide electricity. “That’s attainable, that’s not a huge technical challenge. The question is at what cost,” Jonathan Banks, a research associate in geoscience at the University of Alberta, told DeSmog Canada. The town recently got $1.2 million in federal and provincial grants to explore the feasibility of the project, known as a Front-End Engineering and Design, or FEED, study. That should be complete by the end of the summer. “If the FEED study shows that the project is viable…we could start building the system in the fall of 2018,” Banks says, cautioning that there are a number of unknowns, such as an uncertain regulatory process. Like many Canadian jurisdictions, Alberta currently has no regulatory framework for geothermal power. The project would be a first for Canada. That has led to apprehension among residents, who tend to be conservative in their approach to energy. Related: Geothermal Makes Breakthrough in Canada's Federal Budget — Now What? “There’s always insecurity when you’re building something for the first time,” explains newly elected town councillor Dewly Nelson. Nelson himself started as a critic of the project. Working for the Chamber of Commerce — some of whose members were concerned about the town wasting money — he set about trying to research the project. “I came up with a little different of an answer than I think people were hoping for,” he says. He now chairs a committee on alternative energy in the community. “I’m a bit of an evangelist,” he laughs. A 2016 preliminary study suggested that the cost of a geothermal heating system for the town could be recouped in about 16 years against business-as-usual heating costs. Nelson concedes the number “could be a little optimistic” at $10.2 million due to the number of hurdles associated with it being the first of its kind. But he maintains that the benefits of the project extend beyond the lifetime cost (despite insisting that, as a municipal project, for it to be recouping any revenue at all is a plus). He says the spinoff benefits could be in new businesses setting up shop in Hinton due to the cheap, long-term heating contracts the town would be able to provide. “I think we’ll be surprised at some of the different uses that other people think of,” he says, offering as an example a greenhouse for the fledgling cannabis market. He also points to Boise, Idaho, which uses its similar system to heat an alligator farm. In Klamath Falls, Oregon, a brewery makes use of the heat. The town’s partner in the project, Calgary-based Epoch Energy, has visited some of those sites to survey their systems. Related: Six Natural Resource Projects in Canada That Got it Right in 2017 “Seeing it as a tool for diversifying our economy, that’s the biggest winner for it,” Nelson says. Two hours away on the other side of the B.C. border, Valemount is also looking at building a “geothermal industrial park” that would make use of a relatively accessible pocket of heat they suspect to be just underneath the town. That could produce electricity, heat water for a brewery, warm a greenhouse and even keep the sidewalks ice-free. Nelson explains that the American projects also have other lessons to offer Hinton: they charge differently for the use of the power. In Klamath Falls, users are charged directly for the heat. In Boise, users are charged by the volume of water they use, encouraging innovation around efficiency. Winning over skeptical residents, both Nelson and Banks agree, has been a process of continual engagement and education. “It doesn’t take a lot to connect with people, and just plant that seed,” Nelson says. A big part of why Nelson thinks the oil-friendly residents should welcome geothermal to town? It all runs on the same infrastructure and knowledge as the oil and gas industry, making it an excellent way to make use of existing oilfields and some of the workers who have been hit by low oil prices. “If it ever really takes off on a large scale in Canada, it will be because of oil and gas,” he says.

New York City Police Officers Fatally Shot a Man After Mistaking a Pipe for a Gun,"(NEW YORK) — Police officers responding to reports of a man threatening people with a gun on Wednesday fatally shot a man carrying a metal pipe, mistaking it for a firearm, police said. It happened just before 5 p.m. in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn after three 911 callers said a “man was pointing a silver firearm at people on the street,” according to NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Five officers, three in plainclothes and two in uniform, responded and encountered a man matching the description in the 911 calls. “The suspect took a two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at the approaching officers, two of whom were in uniform, said Monahan. Four of the officers then fired a total of 10 rounds, striking the man, who was later found to be holding a “pipe with some sort of knob at the end,” he said. The unidentified man was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Four officers were treated for minor injuries. Dozens of police cars converged on the area, and a crowd of about 200 people gathered around the cordoned-off intersection, said 33-year-old resident Shaya Tenenbaum, who added that a few people in the crowd shouted at police. Andre Wilson, 38, told the Daily News that he has known the victim for 20 years, describing him as a quirky neighborhood character. “All he did was just walk around the neighborhood,” he said. “He speaks to himself, usually he has an orange Bible or a rosary in his hand. He never had a problem with anyone.” Wilson said he was shocked that it would come to this. “The officers from the neighborhood, they know him. He has no issue with violence. Everybody just knows he’s just mentally challenged. This shouldn’t have happened at all.” The shooting comes after the police killing of an unarmed black man on March 18 in Sacramento, California, sparked two weeks of protests and calls for police reform. Stephon Clark, 22, was shot by officers responding to a report of someone breaking car windows. Police said they thought he had a gun, but he was carrying only a cellphone. In a private autopsy commissioned by Clark’s family, prominent pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu announced that Clark was hit by eight bullets — six in the back, one in the neck and one in the thigh — and took three to 10 minutes to die. Police waited about five minutes before rendering medical aid.","['NEW YORK', 'Brooklyn', 'Sacramento', 'California']","[40.7127281, 40.6526006, 38.5810606, 36.7014631]","[-74.0060152, -73.9497211, -121.493895, -118.755997]"

Wavepiston reaches full equity issue subscription,"Illustration/Wavepiston’s energy collector (Photo: Wavepiston) Danish wave energy developer Wavepiston has informed that all of the 100,000 shares in the company’s equity issue have been subscribed. Hitting the full subscription added $329,000 (DKK 2 million) to Wavepiston’s equity, the company informed through social media. The secured funding will be used to help finance two projects related to the optimization of energy collectors used for the company’s wave energy system, Wavepiston said Its wave energy system consists of a steel wire stretched between two anchored buoys. The device works when waves roll along the wire moving the plates back and forth. The moving plates pump seawater into pipe which leads it to a turbine that produces electricity. Early in March 2018, Wavepiston installed the latest version of its wave energy collector on the prototype string deployed off the coast of Denmark. Aside from two projects expected to benefit from the equity issue funding, Wavepiston will also use the proceeds to retrieve longer data series to verify the energy production and durability, and prepare for the demonstration phase expected to begin in the second half 2018, the company said.

"Woman, 20, killed after bullet ricocheted off wall in gang territory, court told","A young woman was killed when a bullet ricocheted off a wall and hit her in the back as she stood in the heart of gang territory, a court heard. Mohanna Abdhou, 20, known as Montana, was caught in a hail of gunfire from two masked men on bicycles, a jury was told. The alleged killers Mohammed Tawfik, 19, and Kylann Grannum, 21, were helped by a 17-year-old boy who provided them with a bike and a place to change, the Old Bailey heard. The three defendants are on trial for murder alongside Grannum’s girlfriend Kathleen Peddar, 21, who is accused of assisting the alleged gunmen to evade capture in the hours after the shooting. Prosecutor Anthony Orchard QC said the victim was killed on the evening of May 26 last year on the South Kilburn Estate, in north west London. Mohanna Abdhou was not thought to be a specific target (Metropolitan Police/PA) He said: “Mohanna was shot by two masked gunmen who approached, riding pedal cycles, the group she was with. “At least three, probably more, shots were fired in the direction of her group. “One bullet ricocheted off a wall and hit Mohanna in the back, severing her pelvic artery. She died at the scene.” Miss Abdhou, of Hayes, was not believed to be a specific target of the shooting. Mr Orchard told jurors the killing followed years of tit-for-tat violence between two rival gangs whose territories lie just half a mile apart. The Mozart Estate is the home turf of the Harrow Boys or HRB who had a long-running dispute with a gang known as Killy or SK from the South Kilburn Estate. The prosecutor said Tawfik and Grannum were linked with HRB while the 17-year-old defendant mixed with people from the same gang. He said the shooting took place while the victim was standing in the middle of the South Kilburn Estate, the heart of the rival gang’s territory. Tawfik, from Kilburn, Grannum, of no fixed abode, and the youth, who cannot be identified, have pleaded not guilty to murder.

After a few years of development and an early access program, Dropbox is releasing Smart Sync for all its business customers. Previously, some businesses could get request early access, but now anyone administering a Dropbox Business account will be able to enable the feature for their users. Somewhat ironically, Smart Sync has also been available to anyone paying for the $20 / month Dropbox Professional plan -- an option for individuals that pairs 1TB of storage with extra features like this one. Dropbox is also releasing a new selective sync feature for Business customers that'll let account administrators pick a selected set of folders that'll be automatically synced with new users by default. It's meant to make it easier to get the essential documents that new employees need out with minimal friction (without eating up all the hard drive space on a new user's computer).

Apparently to attain the level of pretty needed for such an impact, he enlisted the help of a makeup artist and also used the “pretty girl” filter on his phone camera.

Annual Review of Global Biopesticide and Biocontrol Industry 2017,"Philip Kessler, International Market Development Director of Andermatt Biocontrol AG : Both China and Brazil will have a significant increased demand for biological solutions, as both countries are giants in the global agricultural market. In China, the government realized that, to produce sufficient and safe food for its population in a sustainable way, their agriculture needs to be greener, thus more biological. In Brazil, biopesticides as well as biostimulants are getting more important due to higher efficacy of these solutions, particularly under challenging soil conditions. Resistance of pest populations towards chemical pesticides triggers the use of biopesticides. Furthermore, the use of microorganisms helps to improve biological soil activity in soils, where detrimental overuse of chemical pesticides and fertilizers turned agricultural soil into non-usable agricultural deserts. Philip Kessler: The range of baculovirus products to be used as insecticides has significantly increased over the last years, but its volumes still have a minor share compared to bacterial or fungal insecticides. Baculoviruses are extremely host-specific, which turns them safe for the environment as well for user and consumer, but which limits its market potential. However, baculoviruses are not only used in organic production, but can be easily integrated into existing IPM programs and represents an ideal tool for resistance management and to be used in residue-free food production.

When he heard the news, he told his father: “We’d all be better off dead.” Guhdar, his 46-year-old wife Jihan and their six children arrived in Greece in late 2016, tricked by a smuggler who told them he was sending them to Italy from Turkey. They, like some 10,000 other asylum seekers, are stuck on the Greek islands. They came to Europe’s shores in hope of a life of safety and dignity, but the European Union responded by shutting down its borders. According to the UN, as of January 2018, there were some 1,700 asylum seekers in Samos, more than two-thirds of them from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Nearly half of them are women and children, and nearly a third have special needs. — Children play ‘refugees and police’ — Without the right to remain in Greece , Guhdar and his family now face the threat of detention, and even deportation to Turkey — where they, as Kurds, would not feel safe. Asked how he would feel if they had to return to Iraq, Guhdar said: “That would be our worst nightmare.” He and his family fled Iraq after his brother dared to elope with a woman from another tribe that did not approve of their marriage. Unable to exact revenge on the brother, Guhdar faced the fury of the enemy tribe, who ordered him to either pay $10,000 (8,000 euros), or give up his two young daughters in exchange. Failing that, they would murder him. Despite the threat to his life, Guhdar has not been granted refugee status. For now, he and his family have no choice but to remain in the Samos hotspot — one of a string of centres set up after the peak of the migrant crisis in 2015 to shelter and screen new arrivals. While the hotspots were meant to be temporary, they have with time turned into makeshift camps, housing thousands of asylum seekers crowded into cramped, damp conditions. Guhdar is heartbroken to see his children denied an education, doing little with their time but playing with junk and broken bikes. They play hide and seek — but rather than cops and robbers, their characters are refugees and police. Asylum seekers living in the hotspots are allowed to come and go as they please. But there really isn’t anywhere to go, particularly for people like Guhdar who have been denied asylum and therefore face detention. With Samos’s economy in ruins because of the migrant crisis, few shopkeepers are willing to serve the asylum seekers, whom many blame for the lack of tourists. The hotspot is manned by officers in uniform who communicate in an unfeeling, monotone way. It is surrounded by high barbed and razor-wire fences, which the migrants use as makeshift clotheslines to hang up their washing, and kept under surveillance with CCTV cameras. At meal times, a loud buzzer rings throughout the site, followed by an announcement through loudspeakers. The migrants rush to form a line, pushing past each other to get to the front, while police officers break up any brawls that erupt. Abo Arab, a 28-year-old from Damascus who survived detention and torture in Syria’s notorious jails, only to end up stuck in Samos, blames occasional spurts of violence on conditions in the hotspot. ""If you put a group of saints in this camp like this one for a very long time, they will end up fighting and killing each other."" Aliki Meirmaridou, MSF’s psychologist in Samos, agrees. “People come to this island running from wars and violence, and they have their own share of mental health issues. But they develop new mental problems just by staying in the camp,” she says. Taking part or intervening in a fighting is one of the most common reasons for being sent to the local police station – where people due to be expelled to Turkey are also detained, often for more than one months, and sometimes up to three months. There, people are detained in overcrowded cells, with poor access to hygiene, no access to open air, and virtually no access to healthcare – apart from the consultations that MSF has been providing for some months. Half of the detainees whom MSF teams met had never received any legal assistance. — A flicker of hope, then darkness — Every day, conversations in the hotspot repeat themselves. Pretty much all that ever gets discussed is life on the island and the dream of Athens. They believe that once they reach the Greek capital, they will be able to lead normal lives, live in decent homes, and work good jobs, with their children in school. Those longing to be reunited with relatives in countries such as Germany or Sweden, meanwhile, believe that it is only a matter of time before they are given permission to join them.","['Greece', 'Italy', 'Turkey', 'Samos', 'Syria', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Guhdar', 'Damascus', 'Athens', 'Germany', 'Sweden']","[38.9953683, 42.6384261, 38.9597594, 37.7246162, 34.6401861, 33.0955793, 33.7680065, None, 33.5130695, 37.9755648, 51.1638175, 59.6749712]","[21.9877132, 12.674297, 34.9249653, 26.8192919, 39.0494106, 44.1749775, 66.2385139, None, 36.3095814, 23.7348324, 10.4478313, 14.5208584]"

A new season and a new identity for the Blue Jays,"When the first pitch flies to kick off the Blue Jays' 2018 season later this afternoon, there will be two very noticeable absentees at the Rogers Centre. One on the field, the other up in the broadcast booth. For the first time since 2009, the Blue Jays will open a season without Jose Bautista as a member of the team. ""It's a new look for fans definitely, because they're used to him being that face of the franchise,"" said Keegan Matheson, the editor in chief of Baseball Toronto, a subscription website that covers the Blue Jays. Bautista certainly gave fans plenty to cheer about in a decade with the team. ""From when Jose Bautista arrived until now, the Blue Jays have become cool again,"" Matheson said. He became a premier slugger in the major leagues, belting out 288 home runs in a Blue Jays uniform, including a 54 in the 2010 season. Matheson said Bautista had the kind of power that made the rest of the league take notice. ""For a while, Jose Bautista was the guy in baseball, he was the power threat and he belonged to Toronto."" Of course there is one home run he will always be remembered for. ""His bat flip is iconic, it's absolutely iconic, it was wonderful,"" said Jays fan Ray Payette, referring to Bautista's home run in game five of the 2015 American League Division Series against the Texas Rangers. It was a three-run blast that won the series for the Jays, and Bautista put an exclamation point on it by flipping his bat high into the air. That was just one example of Bautista showing some attitude on the field. He played the game with a chip on his shoulder, and while it's not exactly the Canadian way, fans loved him for it. Payette said he gave the team an identity that won't easily be replaced this season. ""I think it will be a different identity,"" Payette said. ""Clearly the team doesn't have the attitude that he brought."" Broadcaster 'will be missed' There will be a changing of the guard in the broadcast booth for the Blue Jays, as well. Jerry Howarth not only called many of Bautista's big moments, he called some of the greatest moments in the history of the franchise. Fans won't hear longtime Blue Jays radio voice Jerry Howarth this season. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press) Howarth announced his retirement in the off-season after 36 years behind the microphone for the Blue Jays. ""It's going to be a different experience altogether, he will be missed,"" said Jays fan Jared Coffell, who grew up listening to Howarth call games. Ben Wagner will be in the radio booth Thursday, replacing Howarth as the newest voice of the Blue Jays.

Knife crime is surging in London,"The press is alarmed. Last weekend the Sunday Times claimed that London “is starting to look a bit like New York once did”. That is overstating things. London’s murder tally last year was far lower than that of New York, let alone that city’s peak of 2,245 in 1990. There were 130 murders in London in 2017, compared with 292 across the pond. Though London’s total was a little higher than New York’s in February and March, it was far lower in January. Yet there are good reasons for Londoners to be concerned. There were more murders in March than in any month for more than a decade. Violent crime involving a knife rose by a third in the 12 months to July 2017. The victims are often young and are disproportionately black. Why is London getting so bloody? About 40% of youth homicides are gang-related. Some target teenagers who are being used to run cash and drugs to lucrative markets beyond the capital. Feuds escalate more quickly than in the past, because rival gangs goad each other on social media, police say. Others point to the dwindling number of coppers on the beat: the number of officers in England and Wales has fallen by 19% since its peak in 2010. “Neighbourhood policing has all but vanished,” says David Lammy, a Labour MP in north London. “The intelligence that police pick up on the ground isn’t really there.” London’s newish chief of police, Cressida Dick, agrees with the mayor that the force should reverse the decline in the use of stop-and-search powers, which have been criticised for targeting ethnic minorities. She also wants knife crime to be regarded as a public-health issue, making it a priority for the health service and councils as well as the police. Such measures will come too late for Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, the 17-year-old who died on April 2nd. “To my baby Nesha,” her mother wrote on a note attached to flowers she left at the scene, “I’m gonna miss you so much.” This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline ""London’s bleeding""","['London', 'New York', 'New York’s', 'England', 'Wales', 'Nesha', 'Britain']","[51.5074456, 40.7127281, 7.9631123, 52.5310214, 52.2928116, 37.2908247, 54.3151594]","[-0.1277653, -74.0060152, -11.7636869, -1.2649062, -3.73893, 49.7710611, -1.9181532]"
Cairo academy looks for future Mohamed Salah,"CAIRO - On a perfectly manicured grass field in Cairo's gated suburb of Madinaty, boys train in red football jerseys and dream of becoming the next Mohamed Salah. At the Liverpool Academy, football players aged five to 18 train on the grounds of the British International School, nestled between brand new roads and development blocks. ""Here! Here!,"" shouted Yehia Hammad to his teammates, waving his arms as they hurried around the field responding to directions given by coaches. Yehia's favourite player? ""Mohamed Salah,"" he answers with pride, sporting a thick mop of hair which resembles that of Liverpool's high-scoring Egyptian international striker. ""I love football because it's my favourite thing, my life, and my thoughts and everything,"" said Hammad. The young boy was accompanied by his father, Mostafa Hammad, a manager at a Danish pharmaceutical company, who also loves the sport. - Emulating Salah - Yehia Hammad's dream is to be the next Salah, who rose to stardom in the English Premier League from humble beginnings in a village north of Cairo, in the Nile Delta. ""Even better than him,"" said Hammad, cheekily. To enrol him in the academy, Hammad's parents pay a subscription fee of 8,000 Egyptian pounds (about $453, 371 euros) a year. Counting in equipment, competition fees and sessions with a nutritionist, his parents spend more than 22,000 pounds per year, in a country where the average monthly salary is less than $250. Mostafa Hammad said that previously there was a lack of international football academies in Egypt teaching children fundamental skills. ""With the presence of these academies, these values, this consistency, I think the coming period will produce excellent players in Egypt,"" he said. The Liverpool Academy is not focused on producing the next Salah, according to head coach David Ridler, a British former professional footballer who came to Cairo six years ago to run the Madinaty academy. ""Our programme aims to bring Liverpool to a (different) country."" The academies are directly managed by the Premier League club, with the goal being to ""develop (players) as people as well as develop their football skills, and life skills as well"". Most of the children attend one of the international private schools, where English is the main language. Like most of his teammates, Hammad speaks in a mix of Egyptian Arabic and English. Some parents at the academy even brag about how well their children have mastered the language. Although many Egyptian support either Real Madrid or Barcelona, Liverpool have gained popularity since Salah joined the club this season. As well as leading the Premier League scoring charts, Salah helped fire Egypt to a first World Cup appearance in 28 years, in Russia later this year. - Extremely respected - His goals, speed and agility inspire Hammad and his teammates. But that's not the only reason. ""He's a good man,"" said Hammad. Salah is extremely respected in Egypt for his charity work. Unlike Hammad, Salah never benefited from such upscale training facilities -- nor, for that matter, did either of the world's best two players, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Yet it is the talent of these football stars and their success that has led to the expansion of academies in Egypt, according to Mohamed 'Beebo' Khaled, the Liverpool academy's technical director and coach. ""It will take the academy a long time to produce someone like Messi or Christiano or Salah,"" Khaled said. But the core of the academy's ""values"" is to encourage children's ""ambition"" to become the next Salah, added Khaled. Beyond Madinaty, Liverpool have other academy branches in Rehab and New Cairo that are also new and affluent communities on the outskirts of the capital. And while the setting for these academies is a world away from the dirt roads of Salah's modest home village of Nagrig, it is his rise to the player who cost Liverpool آ£44 million (49.5 million euros, $60.8 million) from Roma in June that inspires them.","['Cairo', 'Liverpool', 'Egypt', 'Barcelona', 'Russia', 'Rehab', 'New Cairo', 'Nagrig', 'Roma']","[30.0443879, 53.4071991, 26.2540493, 41.3828939, 64.6863136, 7.0057206, 30.0277688, 30.97243, 41.8933203]","[31.2357257, -2.99168, 29.2675469, 2.1774322, 97.7453061, -9.5491367, 31.4756825, 30.86705, 12.4829321]"

This week Pandora’s Box: Unleashing Evil examines the crimes Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and his brother, James Tyler Williams, 29, who burned down several synagogues and murdered a gay couple. Gay couple 50 year-old Gary Matson and 40-year-old Winfield Mowden were found dead in the their bed on July 1, 1999. Prior to the discovery Matson’s father had called their home and heard a new answering machine message, saying that they were ill and going away for a few days. The recording sounded off to Matson Snr. and he drove to their home, where the bodies were discovered. The men were naked in their bed and each had been shot multiple times in the head. There was no sign of a break-in or anything stolen from the house, but Matson’s car was taken and police found about 50 miles away close to Yuba City. It was there on July 7 that the brothers were arrested by detectives after they used a credit card taken from the couple’s home to order a delivery to a drop box in the town. Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder. The investigation soon turned up their links and obsession with various white supremacist and extreme religious groups , including the World Church of Creator (Creativity Movement). This latter link interested the police as an associate of the church, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, had shot several people just days before the Williams committed their murders. The search of the brother’s home also turned up some ammunition and black powder, as well as a hit list. This included members of the Jewish community in the Sacramento area and led to them being tied to the arson attacks on the synagogues and one on an abortion clinic. Matthew Williams eventually confessed to the arson attack, although he claimed they were carried out with a group of men – that did not include his brother Tyler. In 2001 the brothers both pleaded guilty to the arsons, with Matthew being sentenced to 30 years nad Tyler being given 21 years. In 2002, after an attack on a guard, Matthew Williams slashed his wrists whilst in segregation and bled to death. Just two day before he’d signed a confession, where he admitted murdering Matson and Mowder. in the confession he stated that his brother was innocent and that he killed them alone. However, the court rejected the document when it was presented by Tyler’s attorney and in 2003 he pleaded guilty to the murders.

China advocates dual-track approach to solve Korean Peninsula nuclear issue: FM,". China advocates the Korean Peninsula should be denuclearized and a peace mechanism established, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in Moscow, Russia Thursday. All sides should work toward denuclearization on the peninsula as it is the key to all related problems and the path to long-term peace and stability, Wang told a news conference following his talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, Russia on April 5th, 2018. [Photo: fmprc.gov.cn] The Korean Peninsula nuclear issue is closely connected to the security threat facing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for a long time, said Wang, who is visiting Russia as the special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping. It is absolutely reasonable and obligatory to address the DPRK's security concerns during the process of denuclearization, Wang said. The Korean Peninsula nuclear issue should be dealt with stage by stage with concerted efforts from all parties to seek a package of solutions, the top Chinese diplomat said. Against the backdrop that the DPRK and the United States lack basic mutual trust, relevant parties should promote the peace process step by step and meet each other half way with the precondition of denuclearization, he said. At different stages, relevant parties should take responsibilities and obligations accordingly so that the peace process will proceed in a sustainable manner and negotiations will not be interrupted, Wang said. Wang said peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula are in the interest of China and Russia, which have made unremitting efforts together in recent years for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue, including creating a feasible roadmap. He said China and Russia welcome and support the notable improvement in the situation on the peninsula and appreciate the efforts made by relevant parties, including the DPRK and South Korea. China and Russia hope that relevant parties could grasp the opportunities of the DPRK-South Korea summit and the DPRK-U.S. summit to completely defuse the tensions on the peninsula to avert a war or chaos, Wang said. He said China and Russia will continue to strengthen coordination and keep in touch with other stakeholders in the issue to jointly cement the hard-won momentum of negotiations and secure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.","['China', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'the United States', 'DPRK', 'South Korea', 'U.S.']","[35.000074, 55.7505412, 64.6863136, 47.8281626, 40.3736611, 36.638392, 48.6840558]","[104.999927, 37.6174782, 97.7453061, -122.598365, 127.0870417, 127.6961188, 9.0096574]"
Hawaii's low unemployment presents unique challenges,"April 5, 2018 Honolulu Are there downsides to a low unemployment rate? In Hawaii, which has the United States' lowest jobless rate at a minuscule 2.1 percent, the answer is yes. Employers are frustrated by their inability to find workers. And unfilled jobs may be slowing the state's economic growth. A low unemployment rate is certainly better than a high one. And many employers are responding to the worker shortage by offering higher pay. Still, Hawaii's experience serves as a cautionary tale for the nation as a whole: Low unemployment can mask underlying problems. Nationwide, the jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, and economists forecast it could drop another half-point by next year. That would bring the rate to a half-century low. US employers are already complaining about their struggles to find qualified employees. The number of open jobs nationwide reached the highest level on record in January. Like the rest of the country, Hawaii has an aging population, and its unemployment rate has been held down in part by retiring baby boomers. The state also has unique challenges, such as an economy long dominated by tourism. Many of Hawaii's available jobs are in the service sector and don't pay enough to cover the state's high housing costs. And economists say Hawaii's ongoing economic sluggishness could make it harder for the state to pay its public pension obligations in the future, and fund highways and other expensive infrastructure. US Rep. Colleen Hanabusa (D), cited the deceptively rosy jobless rate when she launched her campaign challenging a sitting governor from her own party in this year's election. ""We cannot wait as more and more of our young people, discouraged by the future they see for themselves here, leave Hawaii in hopes for better opportunities on the mainland,"" Ms. Hanabusa said in January. A recent poll conducted for the Honolulu Star-Advertiser gave her a 20-percentage point lead over Gov. David Ige in the August primary. Hanabusa was pointing to a trend reflected in census data: People are moving away from Hawaii even as employers here clamor for workers. Last year, the state suffered a net loss of more than 1,000 people. On Oahu, home to Honolulu and major military installations like Pearl Harbor, the population declined an average of 11 people per day. The median price of an Oahu home tops $770,000. According to the US Census Bureau, 47 percent of Hawaii's residents spend more than a third of their monthly income on rent. That's greater than any other state. About one-quarter of renters put half of their income toward housing. The personnel squeeze is forcing employers to offer incentives to attract workers. Maui Divers Jewelry, a retailer in the old whaling town of Lahaina, offers employees extra money to cover the cost of driving to its stores from Maui's bigger cities. Star of Honolulu Cruises and Events has raised the hourly wage for servers on its boat cruises to $12 from $10. ""They can be picky now, I feel like. The ball is in their court,"" Sheridan Andres, the company's human resources manager, said of job applicants. Star of Honolulu is also advertising for kitchen staff, boat maintenance workers, bus drivers, and supervisors. Hawaii Pacific Health, one of the state's largest health care providers, is pursuing a pilot program to train medical assistants at five public high schools so they'll be ready to walk into jobs when they graduate. The company has 7,000 employees, along with 44 openings for medical assistants and more than 400 openings overall. The demand for labor is driven by a tourism surge that brought a record 9.4 million visitors to the islands last year. Strong hiring and income gains in the Western US mean more Americans can make the trip. And Japan and Canada, where most of the state's overseas visitors come from, also are experiencing solid growth. That's led to an increase in low-paying hotel and restaurant jobs, which accounted for 60 percent of Hawaii's job growth in 2017, according to data compiled by Moody's Analytics. Hotels and restaurants employ about one of every five workers in the state – double the proportion in the rest of the US. Adam Kamins, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, says the state has had little success in luring better-paying tech jobs from western states such as California or Washington, because of high housing and business costs. Tech firms are instead moving to cheaper states such as Utah, Colorado, and Idaho. An economy with an unemployment rate as low as Hawaii's should be growing about 3 percent a year, said Eugene Tian, the state's chief economist. Instead, it's growing at about 1.5 percent. ""We don't have enough housing. We don't have enough trained labor. That's limiting the growth,"" Dr. Tian said. ""They are connected."" Paul Brewbaker, an economist with consulting firm TZ Economics, said Hawaii's growth rate has lagged the nation's for the past decade. On average, Hawaii's economy has grown just 1.6 percent per year compared with the national average of 2.1 percent since 2009. On a per-capita basis, gross domestic product in Hawaii was one-third higher than the national average 40 years ago, Dr. Brewbaker said. It's now the same. The trend could have profound consequences for Hawaii in the long term. ""Where do we go from here? If we're on this road, how do we pay for the public employee retirement system? If we're on this road, will we ever be able to build another freeway, not to mention a mass transit system?"" Brewbaker said.

"AMLO Proposes Unrealistic Protectionist, Nationalist Economic Policy","Photo credit: on Leading Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) recently proposed a series of protectionist and nationalist policies in a new campaign ad, where he touched on agricultural and trade policies, economic development, and took a shot at Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the US southern border with Mexico. AMLO, as he is commonly referred to in the press, has consistently led in polls by double-digit margins, besting centrist and center-right challengers from PAN and PRI. His new ad, with its patriotic tone and promises to remember the “heartland” so to speak, is a clear attempt to woo rural voters, many of whom live off of the land, and are concerned about the effect of Trump’s agenda on trade, migration, and agricultural policies. Much of Mexico’s agricultural production is exported to the United States via NAFTA, a free trade agreement signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994, which includes Mexico, the US, and Canada. In a letter sent to El Financiero , AMLO clarified his position on NAFTA: “We reiterate our willingness to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, but we believe it is convenient that the signing of the new agreements be made after the July 1 elections to do so in conditions of equity, allow for the construction of consensus in our country and protect the productive sectors of Mexico.” AMLO’s position on NAFTA has been somewhat unclear throughout his campaign’s course, hence his pitch to worried investors who fear that an anti-NAFTA Mexican president would significantly slow economic growth. AMLO also claims in his new ad that he will, “rescue the countryside from its current state of abandonment, and we are going to produce things here in Mexico, everything that we consume.” Ironically, this type of protectionist rhetoric hearkens back to much of what Trump said on the campaign trail to persuade working-class white voters to support him. Les comparto uno de los mensajes que se transmitirá durante la campaña por radio y televisión. Andrés Manuel (@lopezobrador_) April 3, 2018 Of course, this type of protectionism could ultimately be a disservice to consumers in both countries. NAFTA has largely been judged by economists to be an economic success for all three players, based on the time-tested principles of comparative advantage. Simply put, it does not make sense for Mexican farmers or artisans to produce a commodity in Mexico if it can be made far more efficiently and cheaply in the United States; and vice-versa. This type of populist rhetoric may succeed in wooing rural Mexicans, but it does not make for good economic policy. While NAFTA is generally viewed to have had a positive effect on all three participants, Mexico has not experienced the economic benefits they hoped for. GDP has grown slowly and steadily, while the expected wage growth has not materialized. Exports and foreign investment, however, have skyrocketed under the agreement. AMLO makes the typical politician pitch with regard to wages, saying, “there are going to be good jobs and fair wages in the country. The Mexican people will be to work where they were born, near their families, where they can practice their traditions and customs. Those who go abroad will go because they want to, not because they need to.” Again, it has been a tired saying across the political spectrum for decades, if not centuries, but light on details. How, exactly, is AMLO going to dramatically improve those stagnant wages? Latin American history shows the perils for governments of balancing unemployment and inflation. The story of Argentina, particularly, demonstrates the destructive potential of powerful public sector unions that place great strains on public resources, and lead to economic crises. Deep down we feel that the people of Mexico were deceived with the energy reform and that we must review it – AMLO talking about rolling back Pemex privatization On the campaign trail, AMLO has largely avoided direct sparring with Donald Trump but appears to vacillate at times regarding his commitment to the landmark free trade pact. While he has been critical of the agreement at times and favored economic isolation, at a campaign stop in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from the United States, he called for an extended free-trade zone and pledged to slash the unpopular value-added tax, or IVA, from 16% to 8%. But like his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro, AMLO appears to pitch economic proposals that are not rooted in reality. While he pledges to cut taxes, to thunderous populist applause, he also promises to double pensions for seniors, pay farmers guaranteed prices for their goods, make massive new investments in education and telecommunications, and double the minimum wage in his proposed free-trade zone. Just as Petro raised eyebrows by pledging to do away with Colombia’s oil and mining industries, it is hard to see how AMLO could possibly dramatically slash taxes, while also drastically increasing spending on a whole host of federal outlays. It is classic populist fare, targeted to an audience that is wary of Trump’s pronouncements on accepting Mexican imports into the American market. In response to such criticisms of his populist policies, AMLO recently released a communique in El Financiero , in which he called on the business community to confide in him, promised austerity, fiscal responsibility, and central bank independence, pledging, “we will be respectful of the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico; we will not spend more than what enters the treasury, that is, we will operate the public administration without deficit.” It certainly sounds reassuring to Mexican investors, but it still fails to account for how he is going to pay for all of his new spendings, with already strained federal budgets. And like all populists, AMLO has much to say that is music to working-class voters’ ears, but little to say about considerable inflation, that reached 6.69% in 2017, and would only worsen if AMLO unleashes profound new government spending, as promised. Finally, AMLO seeks to capitalize on the anti-Trump sentiment in Mexico, dismissing the idea of a border barrier: “We are not going to worry about the threats of building a wall. Mexico is going to be a great power again with economic development and well-being.” Ironically, it almost hearkens back to the traditional Trump campaign speeches and slogans. However, Trump, despite all his detractors, has at least righted the American economy for now. AMLO’s brand of populism appears unlikely to do so.

The Latest: Oklahoma lawmakers planning rare Friday sessions,"OKLAHOMA CITY The Latest on teachers rallying for higher pay and more education funding in several Republican-led states across the U.S. (all times local): 10:50 a.m. Oklahoma lawmakers will convene rare Friday sessions as protesting school teachers continue to fill the state Capitol and demand more funding for public education. Republican leaders of the state House and Senate said Thursday they will meet Friday to consider legislation to raise more money. Lawmakers traditionally don’t meet on Fridays during legislative sessions. Oklahoma teachers are in the fourth day of a walkout over low pay and classroom spending. The movement started with teachers striking in West Virginia and winning a 5-percent pay raise. It has continued in the conservative-led states of Kentucky and Arizona. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed legislation last week that granted 15 to 18 percent salary increases for Oklahoma teachers, but teachers say more funding is needed for classroom needs. 12 a.m. Some say teachers in Oklahoma risk losing public support the longer their walkout goes. The protests, and some school closures, will continue for a fourth straight day Thursday amid a movement in red states from West Virginia to Kentucky to Arizona to press for more money in classrooms. Oklahoma Republicans passed a tax hike for hundreds of millions of new dollars for public schools and teacher pay raises. But educators marched on the Capitol anyway, bringing with them pent-up frustration after years of budget cuts, swelling class sizes and a decade without a raise. Many teachers already are back at work, especially in rural communities where local boards didn’t vote to shut down. Still, schools in the state’s largest districts remain shuttered, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and many suburban communities.","['U.S.', 'Oklahoma', 'West Virginia', 'Kentucky', 'Arizona', 'Oklahoma City', 'Tulsa']","[48.6840558, 34.9550817, 38.4758406, 37.5726028, 34.395342, 35.4729886, 36.1563122]","[9.0096574, -97.2684063, -80.8408415, -85.1551411, -111.763275, -97.5170536, -95.9927516]"
Why can’t Orange County leaders stop doing such ugly things?,"Protecting its own immigrants and providing housing for its own people shouldn’t be a heavy lift for a wealthy county with 3.2 million people – more than the populations of 21 states. Orange County is one of the richest jurisdictions on earth, with a bigger economy than Greece or Portugal. But the recent decisions on immigrants and the homeless weren’t surprising. Orange County has an especially bad case of a California malady: Our local governments can’t meet the challenges of our diverse and globally oriented communities. “We think of ourselves as Mayberry,” says Fred Smoller, a Chapman University political scientist who studies Orange County, “when we really are closer to Gotham City.” The decisions on immigrants and the homeless reflect Orange County’s fundamental confusion about itself. County officials often portray themselves as weak, playing the victim. On immigration, they saw themselves as targets of a state bullying them (albeit to protect their own immigrants). On homelessness, one official pretense is that Orange County can’t afford to house a few thousand homeless people. Logic is often twisted. In opposing the immigrant sanctuary laws, the county supervisors portrayed themselves as honoring federal supremacy – even if it means collaborating with Trump’s mass deportations. But as supervisors dropped the homeless plan, they posed as defenders of local sovereignty against a federal judge demanding action on the homeless. By clinging to its old image as a collection of NIMBY-ish small towns, Orange County has made itself profoundly vulnerable to sophisticated mismanagement and persistent corruption. In particular, the county has tolerated corruption in its law enforcement agencies. A long-running scandal has shown that both the district attorney’s office and the sheriff’s department “secretly operated unconstitutional scams with jail snitches to win convictions, hid exculpatory evidence from defendants and juries, and, when necessary, committed perjury in hopes of masking the cheating,” as the OC Weekly put it . Judges have condemned the misconduct, which has led so far to the dismissal of 18 cases. But the district attorney and sheriff haven’t lost their jobs. Instead county law enforcement now claims to be defending California from criminals by backing mass deportation that increasingly targets non-criminals. It’s right to be cynical about this. In seeking to curry favor with the federal authorities, are the sheriff and district attorney trying to blunt a federal investigation into their own misconduct? The county’s Mayberry complex doesn’t just hurt people caught up in the criminal justice system. It has given Orange County a government that’s out-of-step with the desires of the people who live there. In a new Chapman University survey of 706 Orange County residents, 83 percent of respondents said they wanted to find a way for undocumented immigrants to stay. The same poll found that assisting the poor and homeless was the second biggest issue in the county among residents. California Democrats have fantasies of turning historically Republican Orange County into a politically progressive blue place. That won’t happen, and it shouldn’t. The survey shows that Orange County’s residents are disgusted with both parties, and worried about the cost of living here. Ideally, Orange County could pursue a middle path true to its people, who are practical California libertarians: skeptical of regulation while championing entrepreneurialism, immigrants, and limits on law enforcement. But that would take a county with leadership that thinks in ways as big and beautiful as Orange County itself. Joe Mathews writes the Connecting California column for Zócalo Public Square.

Morris says he can't stand over HAP houses,"A Nenagh councillor has said that he cannot stand over some of the houses in Tipperary County Council's Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme in the Nenagh district. HAP is a form of social housing support provided by all local authorities under which they can provide housing assistance to households with a long-term housing need, including many long-term rent supplement recipients. There are 28 HAP contracts in Nenagh Municipal District area, according to figures released to local councillors at Nenagh MDC. However, Cllr Seamus Morris has said that there is a need for the council to increase its inspections of properties in the scheme. Housing officer Clare Curley agreed that there was a need to increase inspections and revealed that the council was to employ extra staff to carry out inspections. Meanwhile, figures show that there are 731 approved applicants on the Nenagh MDC housing list with just a total of 27 vacant houses at various stages of work. Some 50 per cent of the applicants are either in the HAPs scheme or the Rent Allowance Scheme (RAS). The highest number of applicants are in Nenagh at 430, with 57 in Ballina, 48 in Newport, 36 in Cloughjordan. There are 26 applicants in Portroe with 24 in Toomevara. Ardcroney has 15 applications on the list. The council has agreed 12 house purchases so far in 2018, with two sales closed. Reacting to the figures, Cllr Morris said that developers needed €230,000 per house “or they can't sell a house in Nenagh”. He urged the council to keep the land around the former military barracks on the “back burner” for housing. He was concerned that some people can't go on the housing list because they are “just over the €30,000 income limit”. Ms Curley said that the military barracks site was “too complex a site” and that it was “not just about housing”. She agreed there was a need to look at other landbanks around the area, but pointed out that there was also a need for confidentiality. The housing director told Cllr Morris that applicants could look at the Building Ireland home loan, which she described as an “attractive option” with a fixed low interest rate.","['Nenagh', 'Ballina', 'Newport', 'Toomevara', 'Building Ireland']","[52.861944, 54.1143359, 41.4899827, 52.8501208, 55.1313118]","[-8.196667, -9.1532099, -71.3137707, -8.0358937, -6.6714305]"
Japan’s ban on British beef forecast to be lifted in 2018,"The announcement follows the successful visit by a Japanese delegation to production sites in the UK in 2017, more than 20 years after the ban was implemented over Britain’s bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak. Of around 190,000 cattle infected with BSE worldwide, 180,000 head were raised in Britain. However, no infection has been found in the country since a 2009-born cow tested positive in 2015, prompting Japan to consider importing beef from cattle 30 months old or younger. Spinal marrow and other such parts that are considered high-risk will continue to be banned, however. Campbell Davis, second secretary economic and trade at the British Embassy Tokyo, said that since the UK applied for the ban to be lifted in 2012, the British Embassy has “ worked closely with UK government and industry groups and with Japanese agriculture and food safety officials to complete Japan's rigorous market access procedures and demonstrate the safety and quality of UK produce. The officials, from Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, inspected food hygiene controls in British farms, laboratories and abattoirs in July 2017. According to Davis, the Japanese team were “ impressed by the overall animal health controls and testing regime. This year (2018), the Japanese and UK governments are to agree controls on animal health requirements and an export verification programme, after which another Japanese delegation will conduct a final on-site inspection in the UK, he added.","['UK', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'Tokyo']","[54.7023545, 54.3151594, 36.5748441, 35.6821936]","[-3.2765753, -1.9181532, 139.2394179, 139.762221]"

Governor to defy Trump’s border order,"Mr Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the National Guard would be sent to the Mexico border “immediately” to stop illegal immigrants. However, Gov. Brown said there had been no request by the Trump Administration to Oregon to send troops. “If [President Trump] asks me to deploy Oregon Guard troops to the Mexico border, I’ll say no,” she tweeted. “As Commander of Oregon’s Guard, I’m deeply troubled by Trump’s plan to militarise our border.” Mr Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday night to allow the deployment, but the decisions have to be made in conjunction with the governors of the four border states. The Republican governors of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico — three states that border Mexico — backed the president’s move. However, California Governor Jerry Brown said without key details — including the number of troops, the duration of their deployment and the cost — the Democratic governor was also unwilling to commit to the effort. The administration’s request “will be promptly reviewed to determine how best we can assist our federal partners,” California National Guard spokesman Lt. Colonel Tom Keegan said in a statement. National Guard personnel would not be allowed to arrest people crossing the border — something barred by federal law — but could provide support to the Border Patrol. Under U.S. law, people who have an asylum claim must be given a hearing, and in many cases are released until their court date. Families with minor children cannot be held in detention for more than 20 days under certain circumstances.

Flying with a pet? Program created to ensure safety,"After a spate of incidents last month about animals mishandled on flights, a worldwide airline group announced Thursday the creation of a program to certify standards for the safety and welfare of traveling animals. “As an industry, we have a duty of care to ensure that standards and best practices are in place around the world to protect the welfare of these animals,” said Nick Careen, senior vice president for cargo at the International Air Transport Association, a trade group of 280 airlines. The effort follows a series of incidents involving dogs on United Airlines. In one case, a 10-month-old French bulldog died after his container was put in an overhead bin of the passenger cabin after a miscommunication between the owner and a flight attendant. In two other cases, dogs in cargo were put on the wrong flights, including one sent to Japan rather than Kansas City. The airline program focuses on the quality of cargo shipments, which are what the Transportation Department tracks for dead, injured or lost animals. U.S. airlines transported 506,994 animals in cargo last year . United was the biggest transporter with 138,178 animals last year. United also had the most animals die aboard its planes during each of the last five years, including 18 of 24 animal deaths last year. United changed its cabin policy to put bright-colored labels on animal containers starting this month. And the airline suspended reservations for its program for transporting animals in cargo as it studies its operation until May 1. The international airline program is called the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators for Live Animals Logistics. The program to create benchmarks and certify best practices for transporting animals was modeled after one to ensure quality standards for temperature-sensitive health care shipments. The certification program adds to the airline group's program of regulations for live animals, including requirements for handling and labeling, the documentation required and a comprehensive classification of the needs of thousands of species. The certification program is open to each part of the industry dealing with animals, including airlines, airports and ground handlers. The certification program was developed with industry experts including veterinarians, animal-welfare experts and government officials. Two officials that helped create the program were from London’s Heathrow Animal Reception Center and Air Canada Cargo. Last year, 16,000 dogs and cats, 400 horses, 2,000 birds, 200,000 reptiles and 28 million fish passed through Heathrow’s center, according to Robert Quest, assistant director for port health and public protection. “Ensuring the safety and welfare of animals is our main priority,” Quest said. Tim Strauss, vice president of Air Canada Cargo, said transporting animals is complex and highly planned, whether for pets, a flock of sheep relocating overseas or zoo animals traveling for conservation efforts. “Ensuring that animals travel in safe, healthy and humane conditions requires coordination across the supply chain,” Strauss said.","['Japan', 'Kansas City', 'U.S.', 'London']","[36.5748441, 39.100105, 48.6840558, 51.5074456]","[139.2394179, -94.5781416, 9.0096574, -0.1277653]"
Democratic congressional forum to be held in Red Oak,"(Red Oak) -- The three democratic candidates running for Iowa's third district congressional seat will appear at a candidates forum in Red Oak this weekend. The Montgomery County Democrats will host the forum from 1-3 p.m. Saturday at the Montgomery County History Center, located at 2700 North Fourth Street in Red Oak. The three congressional candidates are Cindy Axne, Pete D'Alessandro, and Eddie Mauro. Axne is a fifth-generation Iowan, small business owner, a mother, and community activist. Speaking at an October candidates forum in Clarinda, Axne said one of the biggest issues for Iowa - and the country - is infrastructure. “We need to build a baseline for our economic growth,” Axne said. “That means a solid infrastructure. That’s why I’m going to fight for more funding to make sure that we repair and build our roads and bridges, our water and sewer systems, and absolutely make sure that every Iowan has access to solid broadband and cellular. Everyone needs be able to compete in today’s new economy.” D’Alessandro is known for running the 2016 Iowa presidential campaign for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. The Chicago native says he endorses a progressive plan to get the country back on the right track, which includes increasing broadband opportunities for rural communities. “Only about half the people in rural America have Internet that is considered adequate,” D’Alessandro said. “I would support legislation like House Resolution 800, which would amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. Not only would it set up a distinct office within the Department of Ag, it would allow authorization of federal money and development of access in underserved areas. It is a new deal approach to a new deal type problem.” Mauro owns an insurance company and has coached sports in the Des Moines metro. One of his main focuses in the campaign is protecting the tools in the farm bill and crop insurance program that position Iowa farmers for success. ""We win this seat when we talk about fields of opportunities for our current and new farmers,"" Mauro said. ""We win this seat when we talk about a crop insurance program, and a farm bill, that provides the tools and resources that all of our famers need – regardless of their size, practice, and their formation.” Also taking part in Saturday's forum is Iowa House challengers Chuck Larson (District 23) and James Uhlenkamp (District 24).

I hold a BA (Hons) in Divinity from Robinson College Cambridge. Markets have been volatile but there are few signs that a major sell off is in sight (Source: Getty) March was another volatile month for financial markets. The Vix measure of implied equity volatility reached 20 per cent, double the subdued level seen at the start of the year. The catalyst for this development was the announcement by President Trump of tariffs on Chinese imports totalling $50bn. Another factor which affected the equity markets was weakness in technology stocks following allegations that Facebook may have misused client data and a number of public criticisms of Amazon’s business model and level of tax contributions. Taken together, these developments wiped out the recovery seen in the major stock indices seen since February’s sharp correction. In local currency terms the S&P500, NASDAQ, Nikkei and Hang Seng Nikkei each lost roughly 2.8 per cent. Elsewhere, the Eurostoxx lost 2.25 per cent and the FTSE100 declined by 2.4 per cent. The falls in overseas equity markets were larger when translated back to sterling, reflecting the fact that it rose between 1 and 1.75 per cent against other major currencies. Elsewhere, economic data released during the first quarter has been a little disappointing. We have seen a moderation in consumption growth and a downshift in manufacturing momentum. This reflects a combination of the lagged effects of higher energy prices, a seasonal bias for weaker first-quarter data in recent years and adverse weather. We do expect much of this to be reversed in the second quarter but, for the time being, this has been a headwind to the equity markets ahead of the upcoming first-quarter corporate earnings season. Against this backdrop it is fair to say that the narrative in financial markets has become much less upbeat in recent weeks, as investors fret about a possible trade war and the risk of tighter regulation and increased taxation of the large technology firms, so some short term caution may be justified. In addition, the deceleration of economic momentum as the US Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy has made many investors worry that the economic expansion seen since 2009 may be nearing an end. At this juncture I shall nail my colours to the mast and say that I do not think that there is currently enough evidence to support the late-cycle thesis. As a consequence, and despite some near term market headwinds, I also feel that it is too early to call an end to the bull-run in equities. Why do I think this? Well there are a number of developments one would expect to see on the cusp of the next downturn. Here are the main ones to consider: Overheating in the real economy, evidenced by an unwelcome rise in inflation, which causes central banks to tighten monetary policy to the point at which we see a material slowdown in activity which is accompanied by weaker corporate earnings and poor equity market returns. If we exclude the UK from this the rise is inflation has stemmed largely from the one off effects of sterling’s 2016 depreciation inflation, particularly in the developed world, is running some way below the main central banks’ targets. Whilst the US Federal Reserve has begun to tighten its key policy rate and wind down it quantitative easing programme, this process is likely to be a gradual one. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will keep policy highly accommodative for some time to come. Overheating in financial markets. Equities reached all-time highs early in the quarter, but it is by no means clear that financial markets have been fuelled by speculative excess. Cash levels which many investors have been holding have been generally high and leverage (borrowing to fund asset purchases) has been modest by historical standards. Deteriorating credit quality. As the cycle matures, companies engage in increasingly shareholder friendly behaviour, often at the expense of bondholders. This can involve increasing debt levels to finance share buybacks or M&A activity. This may begin to be an issue for markets because whilst default rates a low and falling, the degree of leverage in the corporate sector is rising, which could make companies vulnerable to rising interest rates. We are watching this factor closely. Market sentiment is clearly fragile and the newsflow unhelpful, but equity markets have already made a reasonable downwards adjustment without any de rating of the earnings outlook. Whilst market volatility may remain elevated, particularly in the short term, we remain reasonably constructive on equities as we head through the second quarter.

Maraga denies existence of ‘evil clique’ of judicial officers,"Maraga advised those dissatisfied with court rulings to follow the laid down procedures for appeal/FILE. By NAIROBI, Kenya, Apr 5 – Chief Justice David Maraga has denied claims by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi that an ‘evil clique’ of judicial officers walks the hallowed halls of the courts. Maraga, in response to Matiangi’s allegation, advised those dissatisfied with court rulings to follow the laid down procedures for appeal. When he appeared before Members of Parliament on Tuesday, Matiangi accused a clique of judges of working together with activists and their lawyers, to frustrate government. “You can actually sell poison in this country because all you need is to go to court, get an order and put it on your door,” Matiangi said. And submitted as proof: “In the last 3 years, one civil society activist in Kenya has obtained nearly 30 court orders ex parte. In fact, he could even walk in today and say he wants an order for Cabinet Secretaries to commit suicide and he’ll get it.” READ: Matiangi rails against ‘activist captured’ judiciary to MPs Opposition leader Raila Odinga on Wednesday chastised Matiangi for the comments terming them “reckless” and defeatist of the unification agenda he and President Kenyatta seek to realise.

Trump Throttles Back on U.S. Goals in Syria,"WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is dramatically scaling back U.S. goals in Syria as he pushes for a quick military withdrawal, Trump administration officials said Wednesday, abandoning plans to stay long-term to stabilize the country and prevent the Islamic State group from re-emerging. Trump has given no formal order to pull out the 2,000 U.S. troops currently in Syria, nor offered a public timetable, other than to say the United States will pull out just as soon as the last remaining IS fighters can be vanquished. But Trump has signaled to his advisers that ideally, he wants all troops out within six months, according to three U.S. officials – a finale that would come shortly before the U.S. midterm elections. In his haste to withdraw from Syria, Trump stands alone. The Pentagon, the State Department and CIA are all deeply concerned about the potential ramifications if the U.S. leaves behind a power vacuum in Syria, as are Israel, Arab leaders and other nations in the U.S.-led coalition that has fought IS in Iraq and Syria since 2014. The president made clear his patience was running out as he met top national security aides on Tuesday. Yet the meeting concluded with no hard-and-fast deadline handed down, leaving Trump’s team struggling to deduce how fast is fast enough for Trump, according to officials briefed on the meeting who weren’t authorized to discuss it and requested anonymity.","['WASHINGTON', 'U.S.', 'Syria', 'the United States', 'Israel', 'Iraq']","[38.8950368, 48.6840558, 34.6401861, 47.8281626, 30.8124247, 33.0955793]","[-77.0365427, 9.0096574, 39.0494106, -122.598365, 34.8594762, 44.1749775]"

TORONTO — The family of an 81-year-old Toronto man in need of a kidney transplant has taken to putting up flyers pleading for a donor with the hope someone will step forward. The efforts of Marcel Rozen's wife, who posted the notices on message boards around the city, have highlighted the difficulties faced by thousands of Canadians waiting for a kidney transplant. ""I'm on a waiting list, but how long do you wait? That's the question,"" Rozen said in an interview. ""It's very hard. And I'm not a young kid either, so that doesn't help"" Rozen's kidneys function at 5 per cent or less of their normal capacity. Every night for nearly three years, he has hooked himself up to a dialysis machine that, over the course of nine hours, cycles eight litres of medical fluid through his body. ""You don't sleep that well,"" he said. ""Sometimes when it drains the liquid from your body it starts to hurt, so even when you sleep you wake up."" Rozen will remain on dialysis until he can get a transplant, he said, but doctors told him when he began his nightly treatments that it could take up to eight years to get a new kidney. There are currently over 1,000 people in Ontario waiting for a kidney, the Ministry of Health said. Each of them will spend, on average, four years waiting for a transplant. In 2017 alone, 37 Ontarians died while on the waiting list for a kidney, the ministry said. ""Priority for patients on the wait list is based on medical urgency, blood type and ... DNA type matching and wait times,"" ministry spokesman David Jensen said. In Ontario, a deceased donor's kidneys are matched to a patient on the waiting list by the Gift of Life Network, the province's organ and tissue donation agency. ""One kidney (from each deceased donor) is allocated to patients in the transplant program within the donor's region first and, if no match is found, the kidney is then allocated to a patient listed at another provincial transplant program,"" Jensen explained.

"Buhari recruited over 20,000 force personnel in 3 years ―Minister","Photo credit: Bayo Omiboriowo. President Buhari visited troop of the Nigerian Armed Forces at the headquarters of Operation Lafiya Dole in Maiduguri Borno State in celebration of 57th Independence anniversary on 1st Oct 2017. MINISTER of Defense, Brigadier General Mansur M. Dan-Ali (rtd) has said under President Muhammadu Buhari, 20,000 personnel had been recruited into the Navy, Nigerian Army and Nigerian Air Force (NAF). The Minister, who was the review officer at the Passing out Parade (PoP) of Direct Short Service Course (DSSC) 27/2017 on Thursday where 195 new cadets were added to NAF also reiterated that, the recently approved one $1bn by President Buhari would be used to purchase arms and ammunition to fight insecurity which he described as emergency situation. According to him, “when you improved the professionalism of the armed forces of the country, you are making it stronger and reliable. “Here we are in a country where this type of recruitment was not done regularly. But within the past three years, we have recruited more than 20,000 across armed forces. “By so doing, we have given employment to young Nigerians and we have strengthened the capacity and facility of our armed forces. “If I am to put it in statistics, there was a time armed force was downsized to 50,000 but within the past three years, we have been able to recruit more than 20,000 unemployed Nigerians and that number has a ripple effect on the unemployed. “So, this is one of the things the $1bn would be used for. We have not been able to acquire arms since 1982. All we have been doing is a replacement. But now, we are going for the massive purchase of arms and ammunition because the current security is an emergency situation. It has to be addressed squarely by having the right equipment and that was why the amount was approved,” he added. On the PoP, he told the 195 cadets, who had successfully undergone six months intensive training to place national integrity, self-discipline and hard work above personal interest in the discharge of their constitutional responsibility. He said, “you are passing out at a time when our dear country is grappling with insecurity and economic challenges. While the government has done so much to degrade Boko Haram terrorists by limiting their capacity to launch coordinated massive attacks, there are other emerging national security threats such as herdsmen/farmers clashes and armed banditry which need to be decisively dealt with. “You must subordinate yourself to civil authority and protect our fledgeling democracy. You must know the limits of your freedom of association and expression which must be matched with a responsibility to maintain national security. “Avoid being used by disgruntled elements in the society to compromise national security or to act in a way capable of denting the good image of the service.” He, however, urged them to maintain good civil-military relations because that was the key to unlocking solutions to the national security challenges. DSSC is a basic military training of Military Training Schools developed for universities and polytechnics graduates usually drawn from disciplines such as Medicine, engineering, pharmacy, piloting, law, accounting and education among others, covering both military and general service subjects.",[],[],[]
"Manitoba NDP plan to delay carbon tax law, want revenue for climate change fight","WINNIPEG — Manitoba's Opposition New Democrats said Thursday they plan to delay the province's proposed carbon tax law which will add just over five cents a litre to the cost of gasoline and drive up the cost other fuels. The Progressive Conservative government has introduced a bill to enact the tax on Sept. 1, and NDP Leader Wab Kinew said his party will not let the bill become law until sometime after the fall sitting of the legislature begins Oct. 3. ""They're asking Manitobans to pay about $300 more a year, but they're not offering any programs or any assistance that are going to actually help people transition to a lower-carbon lifestyle,"" Kinew said following a speech to the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce. The tax will add $25 per tonne to the cost of gasoline and make diesel, natural gas and propane more expensive. The government has said it will use much of the $250 million in new revenue to cut income and sales taxes to compensate for the higher energy costs. Kinew said the government should instead use the carbon tax money primarily to support people and companies who want to adopt energy-efficient technology. Kinew also said he would be comfortable with a $50 per tonne carbon tax — an amount pushed by the federal government but rejected by Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister. ""At the current levels being debated — $25 to $50 — I'm not opposed to either one. What really matters is what happens with those revenues and what goes back out the door to help people transition (to lower emissions.)"" Legislature rules allow the Opposition to choose up to five bills each spring to be held over until the fall. Kinew admitted the government could try to enact the tax on Sept. 1 before the bill passes, or lump it in with another bill, but said the ball is in the premier's court. ""If Pallister wants to start charging a carbon tax right away, without having the legislation in place to do so, then let him make that argument to Manitobans.""",['Manitoba'],[55.001251],[-97.001038]
The 2018 hurricane season could be as busy as the 2017 season,"(CNN) — After a record drought that featured no major (Category 3-5) hurricane landfalls in the United States, 2017 roared to life, reminding everyone how powerful and destructive these monster storms can be. The drought lasted more than a decade and ended with not one, but three major hurricanes striking US soil: Harvey, Irma and Maria. Those three storms all rank among the top five costliest in history. With the 2017 season still fresh on the minds of many coastal residents, the question is: What will 2018 bring? Colorado State University forecasts above-average season The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June through November. With the season less than two months away, Colorado State University issued its preliminary seasonal forecast on Thursday. Forecasters expect a slightly above-average season, with 14 named storms. Seven of those are expected to become hurricanes and three are expected to be major hurricanes. While above the long-term average of 12 named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes, this forecast is quieter than 2017, which had 17, 10 and six, respectively. Of these storms, CSU predicts a 63% probability of at least one major hurricane making landfall on the continental United States. This number is above the average of 52%. Critical factors “Last season had near-record warm sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic,” said Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State University. This near-record warmth contributed to the surge in activity in 2017, especially in terms of major hurricanes. While the western tropical Atlantic is currently warmer than average, other portions, including the eastern tropical Atlantic and the north Atlantic, are cooler than average. Klotzback said, “As of now, I don’t see anything in the immediate future that would cause sea surface temperatures to warm up dramatically. However, there is certainly still time for this to occur, which is one of the biggest challenges with issuing forecasts this early.” Although hurricane season in the Atlantic starts June 1, the majority of storms occur between mid-August and mid-October, meaning this prediction is coming four months before the bulk of hurricane activity. What about El Niño/La Niña? El Niño and La Niña are common meteorological terms that we expect to hear for seasonal hurricane forecasts — and with good reason. A strong El Niño or La Niña has a significant impact on hurricane development. El Niño is a naturally occurring phenomenon characterized by warmer than normal water in the eastern Pacific equatorial region. While El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean, it has widespread impacts on the global climate. One of the elements is increased wind shear across the tropical Atlantic, which creates hostile conditions for hurricane development. La Niña is the opposite of El Niño, characterized by cooler water in the eastern Pacific equatorial region. When La Niña is present, conditions tend to be more favorable for hurricane development in the Atlantic. Currently, we are in a weak La Niña, but the forecasters at Colorado State believe we will transition to a neutral phase of El Niño-Southern Oscillation over the next several months (no El Niño or La Niña). Klotzbach warns, “If El Niño were to suddenly develop, that would certainly knock down our forecast.” Regardless of the season’s activity, Colorado State forecasters remind coastal residents that it only takes one hurricane making landfall to make it an active season for them. Colorado State will update its outlook on May 31 after further analysis of the current atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will provide its hurricane outlook in May. The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

MOTORSPORT: Rob Collard's looking forward to BTCC,"Hampshire racing driver Rob Collard has set his goals high ahead of the new British Touring Car season. Championship Collard is currently driving for West Surrey Racing (WSR), behind the wheel of a BMW 125i M Sport, writes Brad Halcrow. He first drove for WSR in 2003, a team which he has claimed 12 of his 14 wins with and took the Independents championship in 2003. Collard won one race last season, in his home race at Thruxton, near Andover, which will again be hosting the third of the ten races when the BTCC returns to Hampshire on the weekend of May 19/20. When asked about his aims for the new season, which will start on April 7/8 at Brands Hatch, Collard responded positively, saying his aim is “to win as many races as possible and help BMW win the team and drivers’ championships.” WSR won the manufacturers’ championship last season so retaining it is the primary goal for the team this year. “To continue to work together to build a championship campaign to try and retain the team and manufacturers’ championships for the third year running,” says Collard. The 49-year-old will once again partner his BMW teammates Colin Turkington and Andrew Jordan, both of whom have won the championship before. Turkington and Collard gathered 20 podiums between them last season, with Turkington finishing second and Collard fifth overall. “It’s a fantastic feeling racing in the BTCC at a competitive level,” he continued. “The BTCC is the absolute shop window for any driver and it’s a pleasure to work with such experienced drivers as Colin Turkington and Andrew Jordan.” He was ruled out of title contention last season after a crash in Silverstone, where he was an innocent victim, which led to him missing the last five races of the season. It was still the Eversley man’s best season to date. The BTCC began 60 years ago and this year’s races will all be live in HD on ITV4. The championship takes place at ten circuits up and down the country, with three races staged at each event. The most successful drivers have weight added to their car as a handicap, with reverse grids also used. The BTCC is known for close wheel racing and the occasional contact. “The unpredictable nature and closeness of the racing amongst all of the drivers means you must always err on the side of caution when overtaking them or going wheel to wheel,” added Collard, whose son Ricky competed in GT3 and DTM last year, as well as testing for West Surrey Racing himself.","['Thruxton', 'Andover', 'Hampshire', 'Turkington', 'Silverstone']","[51.2009716, 45.2332985, 51.0448355, 41.7073832, 52.0877287]","[-1.6245787, -93.2913405, -1.2434094, -72.2113052, -1.0241177]"

There Are Horrific Stories Of Sex Demand...,"Veteran Nigerian actress, Joke Silva, has said that horrific stories of sex demands abound in Nollywood. She said this while answering questions from newsmen yesterday after the launch of ‘Disowned’, a book by Nina Anyianuka about sexual abuse and harassment, at Terra Kulture in Lagos. The 56-year-old screen goddess said the pressure on young actresses to offer sexual favours is unbearable. “Unfortunately, the casting couch issue is alive in Nollywood,” she began. “Sometimes there is this hunger to get the work. Maybe you’ve gone to several auditions and you haven’t gotten the work, then somebody tells you that it is because you are not doing what you should do that is why you are not getting the work. “What I say to them is don’t believe it. By the time the producer, director, production manager or whoever insists on sleeping with you is done, it is very likely you will end up not getting the work. “Some of the sad stories we hear is that because some people are so desperate, they end up getting passed around.” Drawing an analogy with entrepreneurs, Silva said up and coming actresses should not compromise their dignity to get by. “There is no need for that,” she said. “As an entrepreneur, you go round looking for money and you are probably going to get several nos before you get your yes. “It’s the same with an audition. You must keep your dignity. Find something else to keep body and soul together. “That is why you hear that abroad people wait tables or work in restaurants because they need something to keep body and soul together until that break happens. “You should be proud as long as you are earning honest money. If possible train yourself in audition skills.” She added that having more women in positions of power and authority in Nollywood could stem the tide. “We need more women producers, more women scriptwriters and more women stories so that we can then absorb a lot of women in the industry,” she concluded.","['Nollywood', 'Lagos']","[51.4757121, 6.4550575]","[-0.093413, 3.3941795]"
Saint Lucia Schools Benefit From Environmental Education In Marine Turtle Protection,"Marine turtle session underway at Secondary School. (PHOTO: V. Clarke) OVER 70 students from two primary and two senior secondary schools in the south of the island participated in an environmental education programme under a project entitled: Supporting more effective marine turtle conservation within the Pointe Sable Environmental Protection Area. Students gained a wealth of first-hand knowledge about marine turtles that nest on Saint Lucian beaches and feed along the island’s coastal waters. The students also learned about threats to marine turtles globally and about local laws and initiatives oriented to the conservation of the marine species. The sessions were coordinated jointly by the Fisheries Department and the Saint Lucia National Trust (SLNT) using age-relevant and modern teaching materials that helped to capture the students’ interest. In some cases, the students came well-prepared with background information about marine turtles. Ms. Yvonne Edwin, Fisheries Assistant-Communications Officer commented: “We showed some excellent videos which brought the topic alive and sparked the students’ curiosity. Questions abounded and by the time we completed the session, the level of interest from both teachers and students was such that they now aim to start an Environmental Club at the school.” Mr. Craig Henry of the Saint Lucia National Trust added: “The young folks that I worked with were quite into the sessions from the start. Most of them had seen a marine turtle before but could not identify the species. They seemed quite fascinated as they learned more and they have the potential to become active marine turtle conservationists.” He added: “We are thankful to our partners – the OAS, WIDECAST, schools and teachers for making this initiative possible. Several additional schools are requesting this type of Ministry of Education approved training in order to diversify their students’ learning experience.”",[],[],[]

Mother of raped‚ disabled child says police have failed them,The mother of a severely disabled nine-year-old child who was raped says the police have failed her. Noma (not her real name) opened a case of rape at the Delft police station in May 2017. She said she received an SMS in August saying that the case was withdrawn. “I was surprised because I had never gone to court and the investigating officer told me that the case was dropped on 12 June already. No one told me about the court case‚” said Noma. Noma said she had been bathing her daughter when she noticed something was wrong. Her daughter cannot walk or talk and wears a nappy because she cannot indicate when she needs the toilet. “At first I would notice that she came home and slept … She also had baby powder in her underparts and I assumed they [the day care facility] did not change her nappy in time and she had a rash‚” said Noma. She went to call her older neighbour who told her to go to the nearest clinic. The clinic referred her to Karl Bremer Hospital. A doctor confirmed that her daughter had been raped and that it had probably happened many times. No counselling was ever offered to her or her daughter. “I am hurt because I don’t know how she feels because unlike me she cannot speak about what happened‚” says Noma. “I cry because I can only imagine the pain she is feeling.” Noma had moved out of an informal settlement in Khayelitsha to live in Delft after the Social Justice Coalition had helped her secure an RDP flat. But because she no longer feels it is safe to take her child to the day care facility‚ she has now moved back to Khayelitsha where her unemployed sister can look after the child. Noma works as a domestic worker during the day. She said the only time her child was in contact with males was at school. Noma said she was picked up by the male driver at home and the crèche also had male caretakers. The owner of of the special needs school told GroundUp that the police had not asked any of her staff to give DNA. “I am willing to send my carers for a DNA test. I feel for mom and daughter because I am a mother. I do hope the perpetrator who did this will get caught‚” said the owner. She said at the time the school had two male carers plus the driver‚ but both the carers have since left because “they got better jobs”. When asked whether there was any possibility that the incident could have happened at the school premises‚ she said‚ “No‚ it did not happen here at our centre. Our centre is open plan and everybody can see each other.” Western Cape SAPS spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of rape had been opened and was later withdrawn in court. She said according to standard procedure the victims and the caregivers are informed about the outcome of the case and that the same procedure was followed by the investigating officer in Noma’s case. Western Cape spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority Eric Ntabazalila told GroundUp that no consultation was possible as the victim cannot walk or talk. “She was taken to the doctor who confirmed that there were old tears to the vagina‚” he said. “She could not identify an accused. The police could therefore not proceed with further investigation.” He said according to the statements in the docket she came to Cape Town after she was in the Eastern Cape for one month. It is therefore unknown whether she was raped there or in Cape Town. “Samples [of DNA] were collected from the child but seeing that the identity of the accused is unknown‚ there is nothing to compare it with‚” said Ntabazalila. Noma said her daughter never went with her to Eastern Cape. When she went to her father’s funeral in April she had left her daughter behind to stay with her cousin. “Do children with disabilities have no rights‚ does this mean anyone can do as they please with them and not be held responsible? … My child‚ my innocent child was wronged and the people who are supposed to help are the very same people who have deserted her‚” said Noma. * This article was originally published by,"['Delft', 'Khayelitsha', 'Noma']","[51.9994572, -34.0405905, 55.6825096]","[4.3627245, 18.6674201, 12.6107888]"
Cancer Society to Focus on Screenings,"Photo: Adrian Walker Executive Director, Jamaica Cancer Society, Yulit Gordon, addresses recent JIS ‘Think Tank’.

Cervical cancer can very often be successfully treated when it is discovered early by carrying out a pap smear to determine whether there is the presence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) It is usually recommended that women over the age of 21 get screened annually in order to detect any cell abnormalities in the cervix. On April 6, the Cancer Society will be offering pap smear testing at a reduced rate of $2,430 to members of the Society and $2,565 to non-members. All major health insurance cards will be accepted and the first 50 women who arrive on the day for screening will be tested at no cost. The Jamaica Cancer Society is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation (NGO) with a mission to “eliminate cancer as a major health problem in Jamaica”, through cancer education, counselling and outreach initiatives.",['Jamaica'],[18.1850507],[-77.3947693]

Massachusetts man arrested on insider trading charges,"By Nate Raymond. BOSTON (Reuters) - The owner of a restaurant in Massachusetts was arrested on Thursday on federal charges that he had traded on inside information obtained from an employee at VistaPrint NV and that person's spouse about the company's financial results. Charlie Chen, 48, was accused in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston of making more than $800,000 from 2012 to 2014 by trading on confidential information he learned about the international printing company's quarterly performance. Chen was charged with three counts of securities fraud and one count of making a false statement related to a misrepresentation he had made to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his trading, the indictment said. A lawyer for Chen could not be immediately identified. VistaPrint changed its name in 2014 to Cimpress NV. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the indictment and a related lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed, Chen had obtained information about VistaPrint's quarterly results from either a managerial accountant at the company or her husband. Chen and his family socialized and went on vacations in Hawaii and Europe with the Vista employee's family, who, like Chen, lived in Lexington, Massachusetts, the indictment said. Chen and the VistaPrint employee's husband in particular spoke frequently about investments in real estate and the stock market, the indictment said. It said the unnamed woman ceased to work for VistaPrint's financial planning and analysis department in 2015. The case is U.S. v.

Disgraced Larry Nassar has medical licence withdrawn A US state has permanently revoked the medical licence of disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar.,"A US state has permanently revoked the medical licence of disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar. The decision in Michigan would keep the doctor from practising if he ever got out of prison. Nassar is serving long prison sentences for molesting dozens of gymnasts and other girls and pleading guilty to having child pornography. In addition to permanently revoking his licence, the state Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery also fined Nassar one million US dollars, though it is doubtful he will be able to pay it. Attorney General spokeswoman Andrea Bitely said in a statement that it was unlikely Nassar will pay the fine, but the board sought to send a message.

No rest for Washington state's 10th Civil Support Team,"CAMP MURRAY, Wash. - Lt. Col. Ricky Thomas jokes that since taking command of the 10th Civil Support Team (CST) 18 months ago, he has yet to unpack his suitcase. Looking at his calendar, his bags will remain packed for a while. 'When I first came to the CST, we didn't have as much going on,' he says.'But we made it a point to start doing outreach in the community, and not just Washington communities but across the first responders everywhere.' In his time with the 22-person team, Thomas has been all over the world. His team's primary focus has been at home in Washington. Trips to Saipan, Guam, Alaska, Hawaii, Florida and Washington, D.C., among many others, have put an emphasis on the importance of the CST. The team specializes in identifying and assessing suspected Weapons of Mass Destruction hazards, advises civilian responders on appropriate actions through on-site consultation, and facilitates the arrival of additional state and federal military forces. 'When we aren't on site for an incident, we are training and teaching,' said Thomas.'We are always training.' The requirements to be on the CST are just like many other jobs in the military. You have to obtain the proper military occupation specialty. However that's not where the training stops. In just two years the CST has invested more than $4 million into training its members. 'It can take a minimum of three years to get qualified for our positions and trained up to do the job in the field,' said Thomas.'We have had a lot of turnover the last few years. Part of that is people being promoted, people taking different jobs in the Guard or moving on to the civilian sector, but we find a way to still accomplish the mission with less.' In 2017 the CST supported the Presidential Inauguration, the Governor's Inaugural Ball, worked with Seattle Fire and Police at every Seattle Seahawks home game, responded to numerous suspicious packages and assisted with illicit drug investigations; 2018 has already pulled the unit in numerous directions. 'In January and February we had the honor of working at Super Bowl 52 in Minneapolis alongside other CSTs, and we have members heading to Hawaii and Guam, Louisiana, Nevada and conducting training here at home, all before the end of March,' said Thomas.'Our schedule has a return trip to Saipan and a trip to Thailand before the end of the year as well.' Super Bowl 52 marked the second time in three years the CST has supported one of the biggest sporting events in the world. The team has been invited to join the Georgia National Guard's 4th Civil Support Team for Super Bowl 53 in 2019. 'It's an honor to be considered one of the premier civil support teams in the country,' Thomas says.'We work hard to build and maintain our relationships.' All the travel doesn't mean the CST has lost focus of the mission at home. In the last six months they have been assisting in the battle against the latest drug craze -- fentanyl. Fentanyl is an opioid used as a pain medication and together with other medications for anesthesia. However, the synthetic drug is deadly because it's so much stronger than heroin. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's up to 100 times more potent than morphine and many times that of heroin. One fentanyl call in the middle of the evening required the CST to travel to central Washington and set up shop before police could go in to investigate and do their jobs. 'We have the only mobile lab in the state that can even detect fentanyl,' said Thomas.'It is so new to many first responders in the field and is popping up everywhere that we need to come in and test the area before they can do their jobs.' Whether it's supporting local authorities with illicit drug busts, monitoring the air quality at sporting events or teaching other Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear professionals, the 10th CST has proven one thing -- they show no signs of slowing down. 'We are ready to take on missions and continue to build relationships,' said Thomas.'I think everyone here likes being busy and having a full schedule. It shows how important this job truly is.'","['Wash.', 'Washington', 'Saipan', 'Guam', 'Alaska', 'Hawaii', 'Florida', 'D.C.', 'Minneapolis', 'Louisiana', 'Nevada', 'Thailand', 'anesthesia']","[47.2868352, 38.8950368, 15.1909825, 13.4501175, 64.4459613, 19.5938015, 27.7567667, 38.8938474, 44.9772995, 30.8703881, 39.5158825, 14.8971921, 36.2533327]","[-120.212613, -77.0365427, 145.746743, 144.7577088, -149.680909, -155.4283701, -81.4639835, -76.9880428, -93.2654692, -92.007126, -116.853722, 100.83273, -86.683698]"
"Dad ‘smoked meth as son, 4, drowned in filthy swimming pool’","Four year-old Timothy Brooks, who died in a fetid pool at his home on March 5 while his father Zachary smoked meth (Picture: Facebook) A dad smoked meth while his four year-old son drowned in a filthy swimming pool, police say. Zachary Brooks, 24, got high on tina and left Timothy to die unattended in the backyard of his home in Slidell, La., on March 5. A photo of the pool shows it full of filthy black water, covered with green scum, and filled with ‘all kinds of trash,’ according to police. Police Chief Randy Fandal said: ‘There is no question in my mind that the drug use, the deplorable conditions of the house, and the way Timothy was being cared for, contributed to his death.’ Timothy died on March 5 after being looked after by Brooks, who was the boy’s main carer after his mother was arrested on drugs charges. Zachary Brooks, who has been arrested on suspicion of negligent homicide (Picture: Slidell PD) Cops said they found ‘large amounts of drug paraphernalia’ in the run-down house, which did not have any running water.

5:59 pm,"The Commission is proposing to limit workers’ exposure to five cancer-causing chemicals, in addition to the 21 substances that have already been limited or proposed to be limited. Estimates show that the proposal would improve working conditions for over 1,000,000 EU workers and prevent over 22,000 cases of work-related illness. Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, said: “Today, the Commission has taken another important step towards fighting work-related cancer and other relevant health problems on the work floor. We propose to limit workers’ exposure to five additional cancer-causing chemicals. This will improve protection for over 1 million workers in Europe and help create a healthier and safer workplace, which is a core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights.” The Commission proposes to include new exposure limit values for five chemicals in the Carcinogens and Mutagens Directive. These limit values set a maximum concentration for the presence of a cancer-causing chemical in the workplace air. The following five carcinogens of high relevance for the protection of workers have been selected: Cadmium and its inorganic compounds; Beryllium and inorganic beryllium compounds; Arsenic acid and its salts, as well as inorganic arsenic compounds; Formaldehyde; 4,4′-Methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA). The first three carcinogens listed above are extensively used in sectors as cadmium production and refining, nickel-cadmium battery manufacture, mechanical plating, zinc and copper smelting, foundries, glass, laboratories, electronics, chemicals, construction, healthcare, plastics and recycling. Putting in place effective measures to prevent high exposures to the five substances and groups of substances under consideration will have a positive impact, even much broader than cancer prevention alone. Introducing these exposure limit values will not only lead to fewer cases of work-related cancer, but also limit other important health problems caused by carcinogenic and mutagenic substances. For example, exposure to beryllium, in addition to lung cancer, also causes incurable chronic beryllium disease. European limit values also promote consistency by contributing to a ‘level playing field’ for all businesses and a clear and common objective for employers, workers and enforcement authorities. The proposal therefore leads to a more efficient system of workers’ health protection and improved fairness in the single market. The proposal is based on scientific evidence and follows broad discussions with relevant stakeholders, in particular employers, workers and Member States’ representatives.",['Formaldehyde'],[None],[None]

Permanent Secretary to blame for Dominica embarrassment,"'You can put the blame on me.' The line is taken from a song by Hip Hop artist Akon, but today, in relation to the confusion that led to this country rejecting Dominica's request to waive OAS fees, it's the position of permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign and Caricom Affairs, Jennifer Daniel. Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley today read from a report issued by Daniel, in which she took the blame, admitting that she did not communicate with line-minister, Dennis Moses, prior to instructing the T&T mission in Washington to object to Dominica's request for a fee-waiver. He also read from a report issued by the minister, saying that he was never asked to give his position on the matter. Daniel pointed out that her decision is not in keeping with the usual procedure. Quoting the report by the permanent secretary, the prime minister read: ""I failed to follow the matter to the minister as is standard procedure and as I am accustomed to."" However, prime minister Dr Keith Rowley has stopped short of taking action against any of the persons involved, and instead has opted to send all reports he has received on the matter, to retired diplomat Christopher Thomas, whose job it now is, to identify how something like this could have happened and how to prevent it from happening again. ""I will take my time in dealing with this,"" the prime minister told members of the media at today's post-Cabinet media conference. The prime minister started the news conference by saying he was as shocked and embarrassed as anyone else when he learned of the position taken by Trinidad and Tobago, which was represented by Ambassador Anthony Phillips-Spencer. He gave a brief on all that T&T had done to support Dominica since it was affected by the hurricane and read from statements made publicly by Ambassadors Penelope Beckles and Phillips-Spencer, supporting Dominica. So how then did this happen? The prime minister said that Trinidad and Tobago failed to attend a preparatory meeting at the OAS in Washington, on March 15th, at which member states unanimously agreed to support Dominica's request. Having not been at that meeting, there was communication between the Washington mission and the ministry in Trinidad, on what position T&T should adopt. The prime minister said that following discussions back and forth, the permanent secretary then instructed Ambassador Phillips-Spencer to adopt a position that Dominica should instead seek a position of deferred payment instead of the waiving of the fees. That position was in keeping with a previous meeting in February at another forum, at which Caricom heads denied one nation's request for a fee waiver, partly because those fees would have fallen on other member states. Officials at the Ministry of Foreign and Caricom Affairs had feared that Dominica's OAS fees would also be distributed across member states. However, at the meeting that T&T missed on March 15th, it was made clear that the fees would not have been distributed across member states. The prime minister is now seeking an answer on why T&T was not represented at the March 15th meeting in Washington. Having sent the matter to Ambassador Thomas, the prime minister said he would let the facts dictate what actions are to be taken on this matter.","['Dominica', 'Washington', 'Tobago', 'Trinidad']","[15.4113138, 38.8950368, 11.2404615, 10.4430243]","[-61.3653618, -77.0365427, -60.672006, -61.2613054]"
Key Malaysian opposition party suspended ahead of election,"Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian authorities ordered former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's political party to temporarily disband on Thursday in a blow to the opposition ahead of an expected general election. The Registrar of Societies said the Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia failed to submit adequate documentation for its registration and asked it to do so within a month or be permanently deregistered. Elections are due by August but Prime Minister Najib Razak is widely expected to dissolve Parliament on Friday to pave the way for a vote next month. Support for Najib's ruling coalition has dwindled in the last two elections, and in 2013 it lost the popular vote for the first time. Mahathir, Asia's longest serving leader for 22 years when he retired in 2003, called Thursday's order ""tyranny"" and unconstitutional. He said the party was being targeted despite explaining to the registrar that it didn't have certain documents yet as it was less than two years old. Mahathir, 92, said the party will appeal to the home minister, and if it is unsuccessful, it will file a legal suit challenging the order. He also said the party can still function because the registrar has no legal power to stop its activities. ""We will tell the whole world that ROS is in breach of the law. There is no rule of law and Najib is cheating to win the elections by terrorizing his opponents,"" he told a late-night news conference after a party meeting. ""Whatever happens to us, we are going to contest ... no way are they going to stop us from contesting."" Mahathir, who also heads a four-party opposition alliance, said it will make a key announcement Friday on how it plans to contest as a united front. Pribumi party official Wan Saiful Wan Jan said the registrar's move was ""an abuse of power by a regime that is desperate to stay in office"". Angered by an international financial scandal involving the 1MDB state fund set up by Najib in 2009, Mahathir made a high-profile return to politics two years ago in a bid to oust Najib and the ruling coalition that has been in power since independence from Britain in 1957. Mahathir has helped unite a fractured opposition, which hopes his influence will help it win votes from rural ethnic Malays, the bedrock of support for Najib's government. The US and several other countries are investigating allegations of cross border embezzlement and money laundering at the fund, which has accumulated billions of dollars in debt. The US Justice Department says at least $US4.5 billion ($5.8 billion) was stolen from 1MDB by associates of Najib and it is working to seize $US1.7 billion allegedly taken from the fund to buy assets in the US. Najib, who denies any wrongdoing, has fired critics within the government and muzzled the media since the scandal erupted three years ago. Analysts expect Najib to win a third term due to infighting in the opposition, unfavourable electoral boundary changes and strong support for the government from rural Malays.

"FINRA Arbitration Law Firm Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein, P.A. Investigating Another Claim Against Wedbush Securities for Energy Securities Losses","LOS ANGELES, April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Investment fraud and stockbroker negligence law firm Dimond Kaplan & Rothstein, P.A. ( ) is reviewing another potential FINRA arbitration claim against Los Angeles-based brokerage firm Wedbush Securities, Inc. to recover energy-sector investment losses for another elderly investor. Wedbush Securities Recommended the Risky Energy Investments. DKR has represented multiple Wedbush customers over the years with complaints that Wedbush and its brokers engaged in misconduct that caused investment losses. This latest potential case involves Wedbush's recommendations that an elderly investor place approximately 75% of his entire account in a risky, energy-sector security. We believe that the investment recommendation was unsuitable for the elderly man because it over-concentrated the investor's money to significant risk of loss. This is especially problematic because the elderly investor had told Wedbush that he was willing to take only moderate risk with his money. Securities regulators have been focusing on this type of financial elder abuse over the past several years. The Wedbush Brokers Have Histories of Customer Complaints. The Wedbush brokers, William Mark Heiden and Ronald Hodge, are no strangers to customer complaints. At least eleven (11) other customers have accused Mr. Heiden of, among other things, financial elder abuse, unsuitable and unauthorized trading, fraudulent and deceptive activities, and falsifying documents. At least two of the other customer complaints involved Heiden's recommendations of energy-sector investments. Other customers also have complained that Mr. Hodge mishandled their investments. Claims involving Mr. Heiden have settled for nearly $2.5 million, with Mr. Heiden personally contributing more than $1 million. This is particularly telling because brokers rarely are required to personally contribute to such settlements. We believe this reflects the egregious nature of Mr. Heiden's conduct. Several additional cases containing allegations of Mr. Heiden's misconduct remain pending. Wedbush was Required to Supervise the Brokers. Under California law and securities industry rules, Wedbush was obligated to supervise Mr. Heiden and Mr. Hodge. This included ensuring that the brokers recommended only suitable investments for customers. Wedbush appears to have failed to supervise the brokers properly. Wedbush Has a Long History of Regulatory Troubles. The fact that Wedbush Securities allowing the over-concentrated energy securities sales should come as no surprise. Wedbush has been the subject of nearly 100 regulatory investigations, fines, and settlements involving, among other things, failure to supervise.

Settlement reached in lawsuit accusing NYPD of spying on Muslims,"The NYPD has agreed not to conduct surveillance based on religion or ethnicity as part of a deal to settle claims it illegally spied on Muslims after the September 11th attacks. A deal announced Thursday by the city and the Islamic community also calls for the city to pay $75,000 in damages and nearly $1 million in legal fees, and it ensures surveillance in New Jersey will follow rules defined in another landmark civil rights case. Center for Constitutional Rights legal director Baher Azmy says the deal protects an increasingly empowered Muslim community. The agreement resolved a 2012 suit in Newark, New Jersey, after The Associated Press revealed how the NYPD infiltrated Muslim student groups and put informants in mosques to try to prevent terrorist attacks. In an order filed last month in federal court in Newark, U.S. District Judge William Martini said the parties had notified him they had reached an agreement. He gave them 60 days to finalize the deal. In 2014, Martini ruled the surveillance program was a legal way to fight terrorism, rejecting the claim it was unconstitutional because it focused on religion, national origin and race. An appeals court revived the suit in 2015 by reversing the decision. Settlement talks began in 2016.

Energy group seeks to improve public buildings,"A new energy audit group, which looks to examine community buildings in order to access grants and improve their efficiency, has been selected as this year’s ‘Get Involved’ project for The Anglo-Celt. It is the fifth year of the community involvement initiative, co-ordinated by Local Ireland, an umbrella group for regional newspapers in Ireland. The project is also sponsored by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), with a prize fund of up to €17,000 up for grabs. Breffni Integrated was approached in late 2017 by representatives from SEAI to establish a Sustainable Energy Community Group for the county, and take a lead on promoting the benefits of sustainable and renewable energy to communities. The purpose of the group is to identify sustainable energy needs and projects in communities and businesses, then work with stakeholders to implement changes in behaviour in terms of energy use, as well as adopting sustainable and renewable energy technologies and products. Under project co-ordinator Terry Hyland, Breffni Integrated CLG will host four public energy workshops across the county intended to inform attendees about better use of energy in the home, grant support and sustainable transport options among other topics. It’s also intended that energy audits will be undertaken on the following buildings: Cavan Institute; Aughadreena NS; Courthouse Ballyjamesduff; Percy French Hotel, Ballyjamesduff; Ramor Theatre, Virginia; Crossdoney Presbyterian Hall; Ballinagh Community Centre; Cavan Town Hall, as well as any fuel poor homes that identified. “These energy audits will be the start of a project portfolio for Cavan to upgrade the fabric of the buildings that serve the local communities,” said Mr Hyland. The group is hoping to train students from Cavan Institute and individuals looking to re-skill in energy auditing to conduct the audits, which are due to be carried out in June. A full report with recommendations to improve the energy performance of the building will be completed in July. This report will be used to apply to SEAI for capital grant funding to implement proposed recommendations in August. “The long-term goal of this partnership is to give students the opportunity to gain real world experience in an energy project while improving their campus. This aligns with Cavan Sustainable Energy Group’s overall ambition to develop and maintain long term employment opportunities in the energy sector within the county,” explained Mr Hyland. Breffni Integrated itself is currently upgrading the lighting in its office spaces. The group will submit an application to SEAI LED retrofit scheme in the second quarter of 2018. Breffni’s office stands to save 47% per annum in energy savings through the initiative. The Cavan Sustainable Energy Group comprises of members from Breffni Integrated CLG, Cavan County Council, Cavan Institute, together with environmental representatives from business and the community. “We want to be the first point of contact for community groups, home owners, public bodies and businesses who are considering implanting changes in how they use energy. We are a new group and we are continuously learning. We also want to extend an invitation to anyone with a background in this sector to join our group,” he said.","['Local Ireland', 'Ireland', 'Ballyjamesduff', 'Virginia']","[53.0, 52.865196, 53.8639055, 37.1232245]","[-8.0, -7.9794599, -7.2061572, -78.4927721]"
"Inside a White House in tumult, John Kelly's clout dwindles Source: AP","WASHINGTON (AP) - When President Donald Trump made a congratulatory phone call to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, White House chief of staff John Kelly wasn't on the line. When Trump tapped John Bolton to be his next national security adviser, Kelly wasn't in the room. And when Trump spent a Mar-a-Lago weekend chafing over immigration and trade, Kelly wasn't in sight. Kelly, once empowered to bring order to a turbulent West Wing, has receded from view, his clout diminished, his word less trusted by staff and his guidance less tolerated by an increasingly go-it-alone-president. Emboldened in his job, Trump has rebelled against Kelly's restrictions and mused about doing away with the chief of staff post entirely. It's all leading White House staffers and Trump allies to believe that Kelly is working on borrowed time. In recent weeks, Trump has governed at breakneck pace, ousting aides and issuing surprise policy announcements on Twitter, recreating the helter-skelter feel of his first months in office. Kelly's allies maintain that his retreat is strategic. They suggest that the belief that Kelly was Trump's savior was an overstated idea all along and that the chief of staff is now content to loosen the reins and allow an increasingly comfortable president to govern from his gut. But those close to the president say Trump has increasingly expressed fatigue at Kelly's attempts to shackle him and say that while Trump is not ready to fire Kelly, he has begun gradually freezing out his top aide. Trump recently told one confidant that he was ""tired of being told no"" by Kelly and has instead chosen to simply not tell Kelly things at all, according to a person who was not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity. In Trump's West Wing, once the rumors begin that an aide's exit is forthcoming, the ""stink"" on that staffer never leaves, according to one of the nearly dozen of White House aides, former administration officials and outside advisers who spoke to The Associated Press under the same conditions. As Kelly's public profile and behind-the-scenes influence has faded, speculation has risen that chaos could return. ""It's not tenable for Kelly to remain in this position so weakened,"" said Chris Whipple, author of ""Gatekeepers,"" a history of modern White House chiefs of staff. ""More than any of his predecessors, Donald Trump needs an empowered chief of staff to tell him what he does not want to hear. Trump wants to run the White House like the 26th floor of Trump Tower and it's simply not going to work."" Kelly was once a fixture at the president's side, but Trump has now cut him out of a number of important decisions. For months, Kelly made it a practice to listen in to many of the president's calls, particularly with world leaders. While he is still on the line for some of those conversations, Kelly was not part of the call Trump made to Putin last month from the White House residence, during which Trump ignored advisers' advice against congratulating the Russian president on his re-election. Though Kelly had agitated for the removal of outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster, he counseled Trump against hiring Bolton, an incendiary neo-conservative media commentator. Trump did it anyway, offering the job to Bolton in a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office and telling his chief of staff about it later. As Trump spent the Easter weekend at his Florida resort and tweeted about his tariffs plan, Kelly was out of state, though the men did consult by phone. While Kelly has fumed about the ethics questions swirling around Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, Trump was at least initially more supportive of Pruitt, telling him ""we've got your back."" The president also has cast aside the constraints the retired four-star Marine general tried to place on Trump about whom he could see and speak to. Those restrictions led shunned advisers to try to undermine the chief of staff in the press and with Trump. For months, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was barred from the White House, only to return when Kelly was overruled by Trump, according to four White House aides and outside advisers. Many in the West Wing believed that Kelly's attempts to curtail Trump's interactions with Lewandowski, as well as Trump allies such as David Bossie and Anthony Scaramucci, were always destined to fail and alienate the president, who has privately contemplated about recreating the freewheeling nature of his campaign and Trump Tower office. Kelly also has clashed with Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, who lost his security clearance after a policy change authored by the chief of staff. Some White House aides contend Kelly has been intentionally giving Trump more leeway to be himself and that Kelly recognizes that's what Trump wants. But allies acknowledged Kelly's receding power and said he's trying to keep his head down and focus on policy, such as the plan to mobilize the National Guard along the U.S. border with Mexico. The White House declined to make Kelly available for an interview. In public, Trump praises his chief of staff, telling Marines in California last month that Kelly probably ""likes what you do better than what he does, but he's doing a great job."" The speculation surrounding Kelly echoes the treatment of his predecessor, Reince Priebus, who was the subject of months of questions about how long he would last on the job. Priebus eventually resigned under pressure. Kelly also no longer commands the same respect among some quarters of the staff. His role came under harsh scrutiny this year over his handling of the controversy surrounding ousted White House aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse. Kelly's shifting version of events drew a loud rebuke from former communications director Hope Hicks, who had been dating Porter, and dismayed a number of West Wing staffers. That episode frustrated Trump, who also still remains agitated about an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News months ago in which he suggested that Trump had ""evolved"" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border. Kelly, who took the job last July, had previously told confidants he hoped to be on the job for a year. One person familiar with his thinking said the chief of state recently voiced doubt he would make it that far. Follow Lemire on Twitter at and Lucey at Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

"Resign now to embrace farming, Frank tells Oyegun","The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, has advised the party’s National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun to resign the current his position to embrace farming in his home town instead of politics. Frank, who was reacting in a statement he signed yesterday in Abuja, to President Muhammadu Buhari's rejection of tenure elongation for the current National Working Committee (NWC) and other executives at all levels, faulted the view expressed by the party spokesman that the previous decision taken by NEC on tenure elongation still stands despite president’s declaration. While challenging the NWC to tell the world if President Buhari was no longer the leader of the APC, he advised the party leaders to learn how to run party administration from the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said, “I'm telling Chief Oyegun to retire now before he disgraces President Buhari. It is shameful and disgraceful for NWC to say Buhari is not the leader of the APC. This is a way of disgracing him before Nigerians and entire world that President has no say in his own party. “I remember several times the party under Chief Oyegun could not hold meeting, not to talk of taking any decision because the President, who they claimed to be leader of the party then was not available. So, we want to know what has changed now? When it is time to take decision in their favour, Buhari is the leader of APC. But when the president took certain decision against Oyegun and his NWC, Buhari is no longer the leader. This is an embarrassment to the president.” He hailed President Buhari for his opposition to what he described as illegality. Frank, however, said that he would resign his position as the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC at the expiration of his tenure to pave way for new leaders, saying ""I will not be part of illegal tenure extension."" He said had it been the presidency and other national leaders of APC listened to him when he was speaking against impunity and selfishness of Oyegun led-national excos, the crisis APC is going through would have been minimised.","['Abuja', 'Buhari', 'Oyegun']","[9.0643305, 41.0148497, 7.59667]","[7.4892974, 37.6293273, 3.92333]"
"Man sues cops, TTC, alleges racial profiling","TORONTO — A young black man and his mother have launched a lawsuit against Toronto police and the city's transit authority, alleging he was a victim of racial profiling when officers and fare inspectors pinned him to the ground on a streetcar platform earlier this year. The 19-year-old — whose name has been withheld from legal documents to protect his privacy — claims in the suit that he experienced discrimination and harassment, was unlawfully detained, and suffered serious physical and psychological harm in the incident, which eventually ended with him being released without charge. The man and his mother are seeking more than $3 million in damages from the Toronto Police Services Board, the Toronto Transit Commission, two unidentified police officers and three unidentified TTC fare inspectors. ""It's a very disturbing matter,"" the man's lawyer, David Shellnutt, said of the February incident that was captured on video by at least one bystander. ""To our understanding, he wasn't doing much of anything other than trying to exit the streetcar."" The TTC said it could not comment on the lawsuit but noted it had announced an investigation into the matter in February. One of the fare inspectors involved has been suspended with pay, pending the investigation's outcome, the TTC said. Toronto police are also investigating the incident, TTC spokesman Stuart Green said, adding that a report would be presented to the TTC board once all investigations were complete. Toronto police declined to comment on the lawsuit, and would not say whether the incident had been referred to their professional standards unit or to the province's Special Investigations Unit, which probes cases of serious injury, death or alleged sexual assault involving officers. In his statement of claim accusing police and TTC staff of ""high handed, shocking, contemptuous conduct,"" the young man alleges the incident began when one or more fare inspectors grabbed him ""suddenly and without warning"" as he was about to get off a streetcar in midtown Toronto on Feb. 18. The man was frightened and tried to leave the streetcar but three fare inspectors pushed him face-first into the concrete boarding platform outside the streetcar, the claim said. The TTC employees then allegedly twisted and pinned down the young man's left arm and held his right arm behind his back while kneeling, sitting on and holding his back and legs, according to the statement of claim. ""(He) was held in this position screaming in pain and screaming for help for an extended period of time,"" the document alleges. ""At no time did the ... fare inspectors identify themselves to (him), indicate why he was being detained, respond to his cries for help, or provide medical services."" Multiple police officers then arrived and ""piled on"" to the young man, the claim alleged, adding that officers eventually arrested him, handcuffed him and led him to a public area nearby where multiple police cruisers were parked. Police officers knew the young man was hurt but ""deliberately and/or negligently refrained from making the appropriate inquiries as to the cause and severity,"" the claim said. He was released without charge after about 30 or 40 minutes, the claim said. Shellnutt and his co-counsel, Hugh Scher, said the young man suffered a concussion, scrapes on his face and a soft tissue injury to his left shoulder from being pinned to the ground. The young man's mother has incurred medical expenses and other out of pocket costs as a result of her son's injuries and has lost income as a result of having to care for him, the claim said. Both the young man and his mother continue to suffer emotional and psychological trauma, the claim said. The individual TTC employees and police officers are not named in the lawsuit because they have not yet been identified, the man's lawyers noted. None of the allegations have been proven in court.

Obama-era clean-air rule on methane emissions blocked again,"Matthew Daly, The Associated Press. WASHINGTON (AP) "" An on-again, off-again effort to restrict harmful methane emissions on federal lands is off "" again. A federal judge in Wyoming has halted the clean-air rule indefinitely. Judge Scott Skavdahl says it ""makes little sense"" to force oil and gas companies to comply with the Obama-era rule when the Trump administration has moved to roll back the 2016 regulation. Skavdahl says enforcing the rule ""provides minimal public benefit"" while imposing potentially significant costs on industry. Wednesday's ruling is the latest in a back-and-forth series of court decisions and administrative actions as the Trump administration tries to weaken or delay a rule imposed in the waning days of the Obama administration.

Superintendents weigh in on $22 billion state spending plan,"The Kentucky Department of Education is seeing the same 6.25 percent baseline cut as most state agencies, Johnson said, but there are several agencies that will have funding restored from the governor's proposed budget, such as the Kentucky Family Resource and Youth Services Centers. Legislators have funded Support Education Excellence in Kentucky, known as SEEK, ""at the highest level it has ever been,"" Johnson said. According to the bill, the base guarantee per student amount paid to districts will be $4,000. Districts receive SEEK funds per pupil depending on several factors, including the number of students with special needs, the amount of students in poverty and transportation costs. Currently, SEEK is set at $3,981 per student, and a major contention in the governor's proposed budget was a 62 percent cut to the state-mandated transportation fund. In January, Gov. Bevin said districts would be expected to contribute to transportation costs more than they have in the past. State law requires that school districts provide bus service to any student who lives a mile or more from a school, so the governor's proposed budget plan would result in an unfunded mandate. HB 200 includes funding school transportation $127.8 million for each year of the budget cycle, which is an almost $100 million reduction from fiscal year 2018 SEEK transportation funds. Superintendents for Owensboro Public Schools and Daviess County Public Schools say they are pleased with some of the things noted in the bill, but unhappy with others. DCPS Superintendent Matt Robbins said the increase in SEEK base dollars isn't much when considering inflation. He is glad, however, that it's not a reduction. ""....(SEEK) has been stagnant for three years at the current rate,"" Robbins said. ""Any little bit of inflation at all, I don't know it does a lot to cover that."" OPS Superintendent Nick Brake said he is thankful for the increase, albeit modest, but that the state is a far cry from adequately funding public education. ""I'm pleased that we moved as far away as we could from the governor's budget, which I think was almost barbaric for our state to consider those level of cuts,"" Brake said. Both superintendents remarked on the other ""holes"" in funding that are equally as important, like the fact that HB 200 also doesn't include any funding for textbooks or professional and teacher development. ""Textbooks or instructional resources are critical (tools) used in the classroom every day by students and teachers,"" Robbins said. ""Not pleased to see that (cut)."" Johnson said in the original bill, there was a bit of ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" when it came to coal severance dollars. There are some eastern Kentucky counties ""that desperately need help,"" he said and the idea was for some of the money to be transferred to them. Johnson said legislators ""realized that that wasn't exactly what we wanted to have happen,"" and that much of that coal severance was placed back into counties in the western part of the state. The bill adds more than $10 million next fiscal year to help 31 school districts that are suffering due to lost revenues from the drop in assessment of unmined coal, what Johnson called a ""diminishing fund."" Of that $10 million, HB 200 states Daviess County schools will be given $8,900; McLean County schools will be given $5,900; Muhlenberg County schools will be given $129,800; and Ohio County schools will be given $128,800.

JAMnews: Georgia in no hurry to demine border with Azerbaijan,"The HALO Trust expects permission from Georgia to clear mines in a seven-kilometre section of its border, where, according to the organization, the mines were laid by Azerbaijani soldiers during the war with Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan puts pressure on Georgia and prevents demining, experts believe. The ""Caucasian Knot"" has reported that in January 2002, Nino Burjanadze, the chair of the Georgian Parliament, stated that Azerbaijan had mined the border territory of Georgia. Ramiz Melikov, the chief of the press service for the Ministry of Defence (MoD), categorically denied the information. More than 1000 mines are laid along a 100-meter section of the border near the villages, where more than 4000 people live, the JAMnews reports. On April 5, 2013, Sarkhan Musaev, who was looking for a cow in the area, stepped on a mine and lost his foot. According to him, apart from a pension of 100 laris per month (about 40 US dollars), the state does not render any assistance to him. According to local shepherds, in summer, it is difficult to notice mines because of the grass. Isa Sadygov, the former Deputy Minister of Defence of Azerbaijan, has said that the area was mined by Azerbaijani soldiers to prevent the passage of soldiers from Armenia through Georgia. On September 2, 1991, Armenian MPs proclaimed the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, independent from Azerbaijan. The conflict resulted in war. The HALO Trust, a non-commercial organization, had to abandon the programme of mine clearance in the area, reported Irakli Chitanava, a manager from the NGO. The works on the border with Azerbaijan are to be stopped until a final decision on the issue will be made, the Georgian Ministry of Defence reports.","['Georgia', 'Nino Burjanadze', 'Azerbaijan', 'Armenia']","[32.3293809, None, 40.3936294, 40.7696272]","[-83.1137366, None, 47.7872508, 44.6736646]"
The New Cold War,"Fyodor Lukyanov, chairman of the Presidium of the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy, Research Director of the Valdai Discussion Club, and Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Russia in Global Affairs, talks about whether the West’s démarche will become a new Gavrilo Princip assassination for the world.* The governments of two dozen Western countries have practically simultaneously announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats. They have thus expressed solidarity with Great Britain, which has accused Russia of poisoning former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.** The U.S. has expelled 60 diplomats, Ukraine has expelled 13, and some European countries from one to four Russian diplomatic officials. Of course, the expulsion of a few people might seem more like a symbolic gesture. Yet, it’s necessary to understand that such an en masse, coordinated action on such an issue – which, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with the majority of the countries that took part in the political initiative expelling Russian diplomats – is an unprecedented thing. The fact that the U.S. expelled almost three times more diplomats than the victim Great Britain makes one wonder who’s the primary director and beneficiary of the new crisis in relations between Russia and the West. The fact that several EU countries — Austria, Slovakia, Cyprus and Greece — declined to take similar measures doesn’t change the overall picture. If, let’s say, Italy had joined them, it would have said something. Italy has always been the most authoritative among the countries that come out in favor of dialogue with Russia, and it reacted extremely negatively to the sanctions war. But this time, apparently it was explained to Rome just how important it was to demonstrate solidarity. In essence, Europe was forced to support the “party line” in a case that’s still anything but clear cut. So it’s possible to talk about the success of the U.S. and Britain in consolidating Europe on an anti-Russian basis. Unfortunately, it’s too high-profile a move for everything simply to calm down and return to normal. Most likely, Moscow’s response will soon follow. Washington is already reacting to it: Washington has said that a response by Russia would be taken as an escalation. In essence, we can now officially acknowledge that we’ve entered into a period of a real cold war, with all the attendant consequences. However, this cold war has an important difference from the previous one. Forty years ago, although Europe was a reliable U.S. ally, all the major European countries — France, Germany and Italy — nevertheless pursued their own policy line and had room to maneuver. Now the Old World is submerged in its numerous problems, and in foreign policy, follows the U.S. lead rather less willfully. Moreover, the current conflict will unfold largely on the economic—and not the military—plane. It means sanctions, right up to and including extremely tough sanctions like those against Iran, and cutting Russia off from major markets and capital. This tactic is not without basis, because unlike in the days of the Soviet Union, our country today is part of the global economy, and every such blow can’t help but impact us. Tension is also rising in the area of public opinion. The image of Russia as a rogue nation is gradually being created. In the speeches of many leading British and American politicians, Vladimir Putin is presented practically as the new Saddam Hussein, with some obvious adjustments for the scale of the state he leads. As a consequence, many Russian-European strategic projects — Nord Stream 2, for example — are at risk of breaking down. Although Germany’s own interest in the pipeline’s realization remains, in an atmosphere of universal hysteria in which Moscow is accused of every sin, and comparisons between Russia and Nazi Germany are heard in the British parliament, it’s hard to imagine that the routine process of negotiating a project with the Kremlin will continue without hindrance. How can Russia respond? We have practically no means of pressuring Western countries economically – with the exception of energy supply pressure, but that would be to our own detriment. A demonstration of military power, on the other hand, is available. This leads to a situation where Moscow highlights military themes. The moves by Western countries in response, which defiantly expand the military contingent on our western borders, don’t improve the situation. As a consequence, the military threats associated with the Cold War are slowly but surely returning. Time will tell how events develop going forward.

Global renewable energy capacity rises by 8.3 pct annually for 7 years,"The global renewable energy generation capacity increased by 167 gigawatt (GW) to reach 2,179 GW by the end of 2017, representing an average annual growth of 8.3 percent for seven consecutive years, a report said Thursday. The Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said in an e-mailed statement that solar photovoltaics (PV) grew by 32 percent in 2017, followed by wind energy, which grew by 10 percent. IRENA said its newly published report entitled “Renewable Capacity Statistics 2018” is the most comprehensive, up-to-date and accessible figures on renewable energy capacity statistics, as it contains nearly 15,000 data points from more than 200 countries and territories. The increase in renewable energy generation capacity was partly due to the substantial cost reductions, with the cost of electricity from solar PV decreasing by 73 percent, and onshore wind by nearly one-quarter, between 2010 and 2017. Both technologies are now well within the cost range of power generated by fossil fuels, it said. China continued to lead global capacity additions, installing nearly half of all new capacity in 2017, said IRENA, an intergovernmental organization that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future with 156 members (155 States and the European Union) and 24 additional countries in the accession process. Asia accounted for 64 percent of the new capacity additions in 2017, up from 58 percent last year. Europe added 24 GW of new capacity in 2017, followed by North America’s 16 GW. “This latest data confirms that the global energy transition continues to move forward at a fast pace, thanks to rapidly falling prices, technology improvements and an increasingly favourable policy environment,” said IRENA Director-General Adnan Z. Amin. “Despite this clear evidence of strength in the power generation sector, a complete energy transformation goes beyond electricity to include the end-use sectors of heating, cooling and transportation, where there is substantial opportunity for growth of renewables,” Amin added. The amount of new hydro capacity commissioned in 2017 was the lowest seen in the last decade, the IRENA said. Brazil and China continued to account for most of this expansion (12.4 GW or 60 percent of all new capacity). Asia continued to account for most of the increase in bio-energy capacity, with an increases of 2.1 GW in China, 510 MW in India and 430 MW in Thailand, the IRENA report said. Geothermal power capacity increased by 644 MW in 2017, with major expansions in Indonesia (306 MW) and Turkey (243 MW), said the report.","['China', 'Brazil', 'India', 'Thailand', 'Indonesia', 'Turkey']","[35.000074, -10.3333333, 22.3511148, 14.8971921, -2.4833826, 38.9597594]","[104.999927, -53.2, 78.6677428, 100.83273, 117.8902853, 34.9249653]"
Liverpool charged over Man City bus attack,"UEFA charge Liverpool FC over Manchester City bus attack. Fans also set off fireworks inside Anfield and threw objects including bottles as the Champions League quarter-final took place. 16:14, UK, Thursday 05 April 2018. Fans were - including flares, cans and at least one bottle - as City's bus made its way into Anfield for the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday evening. Footage showed the bus engulfed in red smoke after the missiles were let off about an hour before kick-off. The vehicle was reportedly so badly damaged that City called for another for the journey home. Liverpool won the game 3-0 and will play Man City in the second leg of the tie next week. UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings at its headquarters in Switzerland on Thursday afternoon and charged Liverpool with acts of damage and crowd disturbances. European football's governing body also charged Liverpool after objects were thrown and fireworks set off inside the ground during the game. UEFA's disciplinary body will not hear the case until 31 May - after the Champions League final - meaning any sanctions would only apply next season. In a statement released just after the match, Liverpool said it condemned the ""damage inflicted"" on the bus ""in the strongest possible terms"".

Zakharova: Operation to eliminate terrorism in Eastern Ghouta nearing its end,"Moscow, SANA- Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the operation to eliminate terrorism in Eastern Ghouta is almost done, expressing Moscow’s concern over the US attempts to prolong its military presence in Syria. Zakharova stated that Russia, in coordination with the Syrian government and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), secured the exit of more than 135 thousand civilians besieged by terrorists through safe corridors in Eastern Ghouta. “The continued allegations against the Syrian government and Russia of using power randomly and targeting civilians are mere falsity whose mongers pretend to care for civilians’ lives while their lies create obstacles in the path of reaching negotiated solutions and saving human lives,” said the spokeswoman. Zakharova called on the UN organizations to continue to provide aid for the affected civilians in Eastern Ghouta after liberating it from terrorism with the same vigor that characterized their work when Ghouta was under terrorists’ control. She added that Russia is concerned over the US and its allies’ attempts to prolong the US illegal military existence in Syria, especially by dispatching heavy weaponry to al-Tanf area controlled by the US in southern Syria whose boarders it has drawn arbitrarily.

Their bond is set at $20,000. “It was a big problem and it’s hung over our heads significantly for a while and so we couldn’t be more thrilled that we have some resolution here,” said Tom Schmidt, Co-owner of Salt + Smoke. According to St. Louis Police, overnight on January 28 th , March 7 th and most recently April 3 rd the suspects were caught on camera at Salt + Smoke, on Hampton Avenue in the St. Louis Hills area, stealing brisket and pork butt from an outside smoker which they damaged in the process. Detectives traced the suspects’ vehicle from surveillance and arrested the suspects, a man, and a woman, at a home in the 500 block of Jeffords in Lemay, Missouri. According to police, after stealing the meat, the suspects sold it to their neighbors who bought it not knowing it was stolen. “Thank you to the police, it really means a lot that they were able to track this down and follow through and get these arrests and make us feel better about going to bed at night and know that we can open tomorrow and just serve a great barbecue,” Schmidt said.

New Hope For Nafta Deal As High-Level Talks Begin,"The eighth round of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations have been suspended and high-level ministerial representatives will meet instead to push for a deal, it was announced Thursday. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland left for Washington earlier in the day to meet with her American and Mexican counterparts. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he is optimistic that a deal can be reached sooner rather than later. ""We are happy to engage as much as they want, to move forward towards a deal,"" Trudeau said, speaking to reporters in Quebec City. ""I believe we are in a moment where we're moving forward in a significant way."" Freeland, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal along with their top negotiators will try to get an agreement-in-principle on NAFTA. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would like to announce a tentative agreement at the Summit of the Americas in Peru from April 13-14. While it was never officially announced, the eighth round of negotiations were to have taken place April 8-18 in Washington. But a representative from Lighthizer's office said high-level talks have been ongoing since the previous round of negotiations ended last month. ""The NAFTA countries have been negotiating continuously on ministerial and official levels since the last formal negotiating round ended in March,"" said Emily Davis. ""Officials are continuing to meet this week as the renegotiation of NAFTA moves forward."" Optimism has bloomed since the Americans dropped a controversial demand that at least 50 percent of components of vehicles entering the U.S. for sale be made in America.

Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped',"Facebook's acknowledgement that most of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their personal data scraped by ""malicious actors"" is the latest example of the social network's failure to protect its users' data. Not to mention its seeming inability to even identify the problem until the company was already embroiled in scandal. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters Wednesday that Facebook is shutting down a feature that let people search for Facebook users by phone number or email address. Although that was useful for people who wanted to find others on Facebook, it turns out that unscrupulous types also figured out years ago that they could use it identify individuals and collect data off their profiles. The scrapers were at it long enough, Zuckerberg said, that ""at some point during the last several years, someone has probably accessed your public information in this way."" The only way to be safe would have been for users to deliberately turn off that search feature several years ago. Facebook had it turned on by default. ""I think Facebook has not been clear enough with how to use its privacy settings,"" said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy for Arizona State University's Global Security Initiative. ""That, to me, was the failure."" The breach was a stunning admission for a company already reeling from allegations that the political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately accessed data on as many as 87 million Facebook users to influence elections. Over the past few weeks, the scandal has mushroomed into investigations across continents, including a probe by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Zuckerberg himself will be questioned by Congress for the first time on Tuesday. ""The FTC looked the other way for years when consumer groups told them Facebook was violating its 2011 deal to better protect its users. But now the Cambridge Analytica scandal has awoken the FTC from its long digital privacy slumber,"" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director for the Washington-based privacy nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy. Neither Zuckerberg nor his company has identified those who carried out the data scraping. Outside experts believe they could have been identity thieves, scam artists or shady data brokers assembling marketing profiles. Zuckerberg said the company detected the problem in a data-privacy audit started after the Cambridge Analytica disclosures, but didn't say why the company hadn't noticed it — or fixed it — earlier. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on when it discovered the data scraping. In his call with reporters Wednesday, Zuckerberg said the company had tried ""rate limiting"" the searches. This restricted how many searches someone can conduct at one time from a particular IP address, a numeric designation that identifies a device's location on the internet. But Zuckerberg said the scrapers circumvented that defense by cycling through multiple IP addresses. The scraped information was limited to what a user had already chosen to make public — which, depending on a person's privacy settings, could be a lot — as well as what Facebook requires people to share. That includes full name, profile picture and listings of school or workplace networks. But hackers and scam artists could then use that information — and combine it with other data in circulation — to pull hoaxes on people, plant malware on their computers or commit other mischief. Having access to such a massive amount of data could also pose national security risks, Winterton said. A foreign entity could conceivably use such information to influence elections or stir up discord — exactly what Russia is alleged to have done, using Facebook and other social media, in the 2016 presidential elections. Privacy advocates have long been critical of Facebook's penchant for pushing people to share more and more information, often through pro-sharing default options. While the company offers detailed privacy controls — users can turn off ad targeting, for example, or face recognition, and post updates that no one else sees — many people never change their settings, and often don't even know how to. The company has tried to simplify its settings multiple times over the years, most recently this week. Winterton said that for individual Facebook users, worrying about this data scraping won't do much good — after all, the data is already out there. But she said it might be a good time to ""reflect on what we are sharing and how we are sharing it and whether we need to."" ""Just because someone asks us information, it doesn't mean we have to give it to them if we are not comfortable,"" she said. She added that while she no longer has a Facebook account, when she did she put her birth year as 1912 and her hometown as Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Neither is true.","['Cambridge Analytica', 'Washington', 'Russia', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Malaysia']","[None, 38.8950368, 64.6863136, 3.1516964, 4.5693754]","[None, -77.0365427, 97.7453061, 101.6942371, 102.2656823]"
US to update Saudi artillery for $1.31 billion,"The United States on Thursday approved a contract to sell Saudi Arabia 180 self-propelled artillery systems for $1.31 billion, in the latest stage of perhaps the world's biggest arms deal. When US President Donald Trump visited Riyadh last year he boasted that the desert kingdom would spend $110 billion on US equipment and the howitzer contract is one more step towards that goal. Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is coming to the end of a three-week US tour that has been dotted with similar signs of his close ties with Trump's Washington. Saudi Arabia has led a large-scale but so far unsuccessful Arab intervention in Yemen's civil war and has imposed a diplomatic and trade embargo on a fellow US ally in the Gulf, Qatar. Recently, the crown prince detained Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri and tried to force him to resign. Nevertheless, in announcing the weapons package, the US State Department described the kingdom as ""a leading contributor of political stability and economic progress in the Middle East."" According to the statement, the latest deal will see Saudi Arabia buy 180 M109A5/A6 medium self-propelled howitzers and equipment to convert these into the M109A6 Paladin artillery system. Separately, the US also approved a $2.5 billion deal to sell NATO ally Germany four MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance drones.","['The United States', 'Saudi Arabia', 'US', 'Riyadh', ""Saudi Arabia's"", 'Washington', 'Yemen', 'Qatar', 'Lebanon', 'Germany']","[47.8281626, 25.6242618, 39.7837304, 24.638916, 23.6053818, 38.8950368, 16.3471243, 25.3336984, 33.8750629, 51.1638175]","[-122.598365, 42.3528328, -100.445882, 46.7160104, 58.4298839, -77.0365427, 47.8915271, 51.2295295, 35.843409, 10.4478313]"
US approves $1.3 billion sale of artillery to Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration signed off Thursday on selling more than $1.3 billion in artillery to Saudi Arabia, giving a vote of confidence to the Saudi military as young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman concludes a marathon tour of the United States. Since Prince Mohammed arrived in the U.S. two weeks ago, the administration has green-lighted more than $2.3 billion in arms sales to the kingdom, including more than $1 billion in missiles while the crown prince was in Washington. The latest deal includes about 180 Paladin howitzer systems, artillery-firing vehicles on tracks. The vehicles look like a combination of a tank and a cannon, and launch 155mm shells. The Trump administration told Congress on Thursday that it plans to approve the sale, the State Department said, triggering a 30-day window in which lawmakers could act to try to stop it. Typically, the administration obtains informal approval for such deals from key lawmakers before making them public, indicating that Congress is unlikely to act to block the sale. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, part of the U.S. military, said the sale would ""contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States"" by boosting the capabilities of a key U.S. partner that contributes to ""political stability and economic progress in the Middle East."" The agency said the artillery would help the Saudis modernize their military and improve their ability to cooperate with the U.S. military. Yet the sale comes amid continuing concerns in Congress and by humanitarian groups about alarming rates of civilian casualties inflicted by the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. Even President Donald Trump has raised his concerns about that in the past, and for a while, the U.S. stopped selling certain munitions to the Saudis while demanding that they improve their targeting. The U.S. is not engaged in the Saudis' bombing campaign in Yemen, but has supported the coalition with refueling, targeting information and other logistics. The Trump administration and the United States more broadly have laid out the red carpet for Prince Mohammed, the 32-year-old heir to the throne, who is on an ambitious mission to modernize Saudi Arabia and improve its image in the West. After stops in Washington, New York and Boston, the crown prince has spent this week on the West Coast meeting with prominent business and entertainment leaders. He plans a final stop in the energy hub of Houston on Saturday before returning to Saudi Arabia. During Trump's visit to Riyadh last year - the first stop on his inaugural foreign trip - the two nations announced that the U.S. would sell $110 billion in military equipment to Saudi Arabia. They said the deal could grow to $350 billion over a decade and include tanks, combat ships, missile defense systems, radar and communications, and cybersecurity technology. Tens of thousands of U.S. jobs could be created, the State Department said at the time. But no details were announced then, owing in part to the fact that the individual sales require approval from Congress that Trump by himself could not guarantee. Officials said the $1.3 billion in artillery and $1 billion in missiles announced during Prince Mohammed's visit are both part of that broader package.

Azerbaijan Released Wrongly Jailed Journalist,"Jailed journalist Aziz Orujov released from prison, Baku, Azerbaijan, April 5, 2018. © 2018 RFE/RL Azeri Service. There was rare good news from Baku today – Azerbaijan ’s supreme court partially reversed the conviction of a journalist, Aziz Orujov, and released him on a suspended three-year sentence. Granted, he should have never been arrested or prosecuted in the first place. But unlike at least ten other journalists who languish in Azerbaijani jails, he is free and reunited with his family. Orujov is director of Kanal 13 , an online station that produces programs on social and economic issues and is often critical of authorities. Police arrested Orujov in May 2017, charged him with resisting authorities, and a court sentenced him to 30 days detention. Hours before his detention expired, the authorities charged him with illegal entrepreneurship and abuse of authority, claiming that Kanal 13 received funding from abroad and failed to register it with the Ministry of Justice. Azerbaijan has a track record of using identical charges to imprison government critics , including journalists and leaders of nongovernmental organizations. The case against Orujov was clearly intended to silence his critical reporting. In December 2017, a Grave Crimes Court convicted Orujov and sentenced him to six years in prison. as a prisoner of conscience. Amnesty International recognized him Unexpectedly, yesterday the supreme court dismissed the illegal entrepreneurship charges and released him on a three-year suspended sentence. At least ten other journalists and bloggers are imprisoned in Azerbaijan on politically motivated charges. They include journalist and blogger Mehman Huseynov , serving a two-year prison sentence on charges of defaming a police station after he publicly described abuse he endured there. There is also Seymur Hazi, a columnist with an opposition publication , serving a five-year sentence on trumped-up hooliganism charges. And there is Afgan Mukhtarli, who was sentenced in January to six years on bogus smuggling and other charges. Next Wednesday, April 11, Azerbaijan is holding a snap presidential election, with the incumbent President Ilham Aliyev seeking his fourth term. The election results are pretty much a forgone conclusion, but unjustly imprisoned journalists and other government critics cast a shadow on the pre-election environment. Azerbaijan should release all those wrongfully imprisoned, and the country’s international partners should use this moment, when the government is seeking international approval, to insist on those releases.

(AP) - Montana and CoreCivic are at an impasse in negotiations to extend the private prison company's contract to run Crossroads Correctional Center in Shelby. Montana Department of Corrections director Reginald Michael and Gov. Steve Bullock's budget director, Dan Villa, traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, this week for talks with CoreCivic's contract set to expire next year. Villa said Thursday the two sides agreed to some provisions, including extending the contract to 2021. But they could not agree on others, such as the per-prisoner rate that the state would pay CoreCivic to run the prison. Montana offered $69 per prisoner, per day, while CoreCivic is seeking $75 per prisoner, per day. Villa says the state will wait for CoreCivic to make a reasonable offer. CoreCivic spokesman Steve Owen says the company believes there is a way to find common ground. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Message from President Enrique Peña Nieto (English version),"I address you today on a matter of great importance for our country. I am talking about the recent events that affect the relationship between Mexico and the United States. As the person responsible for directing the country's foreign policy, a little over a year ago, I established two fundamental principles that would guide our relationship with President Donald Trump’s administration: First: to protect, above all, the national interest, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Mexican people, and. Second: to maintain a constructive and open approach that allows us to overcome differences, face common challenges and reach agreements. Our actions have been consistent with these principles. The Mexican government has worked to build an institutional relationship, based on mutual respect, that is beneficial to both nations. On that basis, we have made progress in the negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, with the purpose of improving the competitiveness of the region and creating more and better jobs. We have also deepened our efforts to fight transnational organized crime, which severely affects our communities. We have never withheld our cooperation, because we are aware of the shared responsibility that this important task implies. And, of course, we have defended, on a daily basis, the rights of Mexicans in the United States, always respecting its laws. The bilateral relationship entails enormous opportunities that should benefit both nations. It is an intense and dynamic relationship, which understandably also poses challenges. Nevertheless, these will never justify threatening or disrespectful attitudes between our countries. As Mexicans, we may disagree among ourselves, especially during election periods, but we will always be united when it comes to defending our country’s dignity and sovereignty. This is why, in light of recent events, the Mexican Senate unanimously condemned the offensive and unfounded statements concerning Mexicans and demanded the respectful treatment that befits a relationship between countries that are neighbors, partners and allies. The candidates currently running for the Mexican presidency have added their voices to the Senate’s resolution. Despite their understandable differences, they all agreed on rejecting all measures that run contrary to those that befit good neighbors. As Ricardo Anaya pointed out “this is a moment of national unity, not a campaign issue. It is a country issue”. Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared that “we need a relationship based on friendship and cooperation for development, no the use of force, not walls, not betting on bad relations among neighbors”. José Antonio Meade stated that “this is a time for all of us to come together in the defense of the nation’s sovereignty and dignity”. And as Margarita Zavala stated, “when it comes to defending national dignity, we all speak with one voice and demand respect”. As President of all Mexicans, I agree with those remarks. Mexico is a great and strong nation. We are a nation that is proud of its great history and culture, of its dynamic present and brilliant future. We are a vibrant country, innovative and full of talent. We are a generous and good-hearted nation. Above all, we are a sovereign nation, with values and principles. This is us: 125 million Mexicans, very proud of who we are. President Trump: if you wish to reach agreements with Mexico, we stand ready, as we have proved until now, always willing to engage in a dialogue, acting in earnestness, in good faith and in a constructive spirit. If your recent statements are the result of frustration due to domestic policy issues, to your laws or to your Congress, it is to them that you should turn to, not to Mexicans. We will not allow negative rhetoric to define our actions. We will only act in the best interest of Mexicans. Paraphrasing the words of a great President of the United States of America: we will have no fear to negotiate, but we will never negotiate out of fear. We are convinced that, by coming to agreements as friends, partners and good neighbors, both countries will fare better than if we confront each other. We stand ready to negotiate, certainly, but always based on mutual respect. Something that brings together and unites absolutely all Mexicans is our certainty that nothing and no one stands above the dignity of Mexico.","['Mexico', 'the United States', 'the United States of America']","[23.6585116, 47.8281626, 40.7645137]","[-102.0077097, -122.598365, -73.9958411]"
Facebook admits its data drama has ‘a few’ advertisers pressing pause,"have some advertisers skittish. Cambridge Analytica When asked about how many advertisers had paused their ad spending, Sandberg would only get as specific as saying that “a few” had done so, leaving plenty of room for interpretation. She told Bloomberg that Facebook was engaged in “reassuring conversations” with advertisers with concerns about data privacy. The slight chill is just one more way that the Cambridge Analytica scandal is shifting Facebook’s relationship to the advertisers at the core of the company’s business model. In the interview, Sandberg reiterated that Facebook’s proactive measures around privacy and security — like doubling its safety and security team from 10,000 to 20,000 workers — will negatively affect profitability in the short to medium term. “We also didn’t build our operations fast enough, and that’s on me,” Sandberg said. She admitted that Facebook has historically addressed problems on the platform as isolated incidents, an approach that allowed more systemic issues to remain unaddressed. “What we didn’t do until recently, and what we’re doing now, is just take a broader view, looking to be more restrictive in ways data could be misused,” Sandberg said. “This is going to be a long process… we’re going to find more things, we’re going to tell you about them, we’re going to shut them down.”","['Cambridge Analytica', 'Sandberg']","[None, 50.3475081]","[None, 10.0090622]"
Trump again claims massive vote fraud. A massive search for evidence finds none.,"President Donald Trump said Thursday that voter fraud is widespread and again claimed that ""millions and millions"" of votes were cast fraudulently. ""In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You've probably heard about that. They always like to say that's a conspiracy theory. Not a conspiracy theory, folks,"" Trump said in West Virginia while talking about how immigrants won't vote for Republicans. ""Millions and millions of people."" There is no evidence that there has been any type of substantial vote fraud anywhere in the U.S., or that undocumented immigrants cast millions of illegal ballots as he suggests here. Trump has previously claimed, without evidence, that millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, who had about 3 million more votes. Voter fraud is extremely rare . A researcher at Loyola University in Los Angeles reviewed a billion ballots and found 31 cases of voter impersonation , while an Arizona State University study found 10 cases in a review of a decade of ballots . Government investigations have similarly found few cases to prosecute, with just a handful of convictions nationwide. In rulings against state voter ID laws, courts have routinely cited a lack of evidence. The president's own attorneys have argued against the reality of voter fraud, too. “All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,” his lawyers wrote in a court filing posted by The Washington Post that opposed a recount effort. The president formed a voter fraud commission in 2017, but disbanded it early this year amid a slew of legal fights ; it had not found any proof of widespread voter fraud.","['California', 'West Virginia', 'U.S.', 'Los Angeles']","[36.7014631, 38.4758406, 48.6840558, 34.0536909]","[-118.755997, -80.8408415, 9.0096574, -118.242766]"
'Jobs for votes': Indian town warns PM Modi over unemployment ahead of 2019 polls,"Rakesh Kumar has a post-graduate degree but works as a house painter in the small town of Kasba Bonli in northwestern India. The 31-year-old, the only one of eight siblings to attend university, said his attempts to get a salaried job had failed, and he blamed the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not creating employment opportunities as it had promised. ""I voted for Modi last time,"" said Kumar, wearing a pink shirt and wrinkled, brown trousers that had droplets of paint on it. ""He had promised jobs, and I was sure I would get something. I won't vote for him again."" Modi's failure to create tens of millions of jobs for the country's youth - a promise which helped him secure the largest mandate in three decades in 2014 - would be the biggest threat to his bid for another term in a general election due by May, 2019, many political analysts say. That seems the case in Kasba Bonli, a market town in Rajasthan state on the edge of sprawling wheat fields, which voted overwhelmingly for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at assembly elections in 2013 and the general election in 2014. ""My two sons are educated but unemployed,"" said Hanuman Prasad Meena, a farmers' leader in the town. ""Many farmers voted in Modi's name earlier, but he has no support here now."" The unemployment rate in India, nearly two-thirds of whose 1.3 billion people are under 35 years old, hit its highest level in 16 months in March at 6.23 percent, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think-tank. The difficulty in getting a reasonable job is so great that more than 25 million people applied for less than 90,000 positions recently advertised by the state-run railways. Ram Vilas Paswan, a minister in Modi's cabinet, said the jobs data was worrying and that the government was working to address it. He also deflected some of the blame onto provincial authorities. ""People expect only Narendra Modi to give them jobs; they have forgotten that even state governments have some role to play in creating jobs,"" Paswan said in an interview. ""Still, the central government is worried about it. In elections, even small issues can become a factor. The government is aware of it,"" he said. Nevertheless, Modi is still the most popular politician in the country and at the moment it seems unlikely that he will be dislodged. Nearly nine out of 10 Indians held a favourable opinion of Modi and more than two-thirds were satisfied with the direction he was taking the country, according to a Pew survey in November. The BJP or its partners rule 21 out of 29 Indian states, up from just seven in 2014. The once-mighty Congress party is in opposition in New Delhi and controls only three states. CONGRESS GAINING GROUND? Before the Modi wave, handouts for farmers by Congress helped turn once-deprived Kasba Bonli into a thriving retail centre, with shops there selling everything from glittery bangles to satellite dishes. But as some farmers prospered, they wanted their children to move away from agriculture. Modi's election pledge to create around 20 million jobs annually appealed to them, helping send a BJP lawmaker from the area to the Rajasthan assembly for only the second time since 1991. But Congress could now make a comeback, townspeople said. Sachin Pilot, a former federal minister and the chief of the Congress party in Rajasthan, said BJP erred by raising expectations ""even when they knew certain things were not possible"". He added his party won't make ""false promises"" but would develop the ""best possible opportunity to create jobs"". Hanumat Dixit, a local BJP leader in Rajasthan, acknowledged the party could suffer in the coming election because of the lack of jobs, but added Modi needed more time to deliver on his promises. Modi's government has quoted an independent study to say that around 7 million formal jobs were created in the fiscal year to March 31. That compares with an accumulated shortage of around 80 million jobs, according to CMIE, on top of near one million youth entering the market every month. ""This is a macroeconomic problem, the economy needs to revive,"" CMIE Chief Executive Mahesh Vyas said. ""What the government can do is may be expand fiscally and create conditions for the private sector to invest aggressively so that employment is generated."" He said the bigger issue was that a lot of young people stopped looking for jobs after Modi's shock move to ban high-value currency notes in late 2016 badly hurt India's cash-heavy economy. The move, widely known as demonetization, also disrupted agricultural activity. The economy, which has also suffered from the bumpy roll-out of a unified tax, recovered in the October-December quarter to grow at 7.2 percent, still below the peak of more than 9 percent clocked between 2005 and 2008. Vyas said labour participation - the number of people either employed or actively looking for work - fell to 41-42 percent of the labour pool after demonetization from around 47 percent before. ""This is very, very stressful in the sense that people stopped getting jobs and looking for jobs,"" Vyas said. ""They will get anxious, they will get angry. The first thing they will do is they will demand jobs from the political system."" Over the past three years, India has been hit by several protests by caste groups demanding that jobs be reserved for them. Back in Kasba Bonli, groups of young men loiter around the market during the day or sit on parked motorcycles. Still, there was no unrest or spike in crime, two local police officials said. Bablu Saini, 21, recently set up a tea-stall outside his father's mobile phone-repair shop. He has not studied beyond high school and stopped looking for jobs after a few attempts. ""I have many friends who have returned from the cities jobless,"" said Saini, in between serving tea to customers. ""There are no vacancies anywhere. No point waiting for jobs.""","['Kumar', 'India', 'Modi', 'Rajasthan', 'New Delhi']","[46.5463542, 22.3511148, 28.3107901, 26.8105777, 28.6138954]","[17.1756684, 78.6677428, 83.7162705, 73.7684549, 77.2090057]"
"Woman asks community to help homeless man, dog living in her neighborhood","HORRY COUNTY, SC (WMBF) - A homeless man and his yellow lab stand peacefully on the side of the street on Atlantic Avenue in Garden City. It's been home for Alan Lord and his 4-year-old yellow lab, Levi, for the past month. It’s a familiar feeling of homelessness after more than a year of living on the streets. ""You can’t judge a book by its cover,"" said Lord. Lord used to have a successful life in Charlotte. He did data entry for Bank of America for a long time. Then, he lost his job, his wife and his house, and resources quickly ran out. Eventually, Lord moved to the Surfside/Garden City area, but a job fell through. “I do not panhandle, I’ve never asked anybody for money, I don’t make up signs. It’s very hard for me to be in this position. A lot of people I think have realized that and if they offer me money and stuff, I can’t turn it down because I have to support the dog,” he said. “People have been bringing dog food and been very, very kind. Kids come up and hand me food and offer and say, 'Is there anything we can do for you, water or anything?'” It’s been more help than he imagined. “A lot of people have really been going out of their way to keep us well fed and keep some extra money in our pockets,” Lord said. ""We sit by the road most of the time, on the sidewalks. We've had many sleepless nights. The dog will sleep in the kennel. I have the tarps over him to keep the wind blocked out and trap his body heat in, and I'll climb under the tarp, too."" Lord is still recovering from a near-fatal car crash that required multiple back surgeries and contributed to mental health problems. Levi is his service dog. “I think I would have stopped waking up at this point, you know. I think I might have given up. He is a very big piece of my heart. People who have kids probably feel the same way,"" he said. Some of the help Lord and Levi have received comes from Doris Lindenwald. She comes to assist every single day. “It’s heartbreaking. I feel bad for him. I get emotional because I know what it is to be without anything."" Lindenwald said in tears. ""I grew up with not a lot. My heart just breaks for this guy. He’s always been pleasant to me and my friends, he always has, and we’ve tried to do what we can to help him.” Lindenwald and her friends noticed Lord and Levi on the street near her home. She got more people together to buy a crate on wheels so Lord could push Levi around and make it easier on his back. She said she has seen him in tears because of the pain. Lindenwald and her friends have bought food and water on a daily basis, and given Lord money. She has reached out for more help. “There should be more awareness to get these people off the streets,” Lindenwald said. “We called Street Reach and they said they had a bed and would take the dog, but just for a short time. This guy needs permanent help and I think he needs help with doctors.” Some were concerned for Levi’s well-being and the Grand Strand Humane Society was contacted, according to Lindenwald. She was told that as long the dog is healthy and not mistreated, he has the right to have it. Lord said he is willing to take the next step. ""We are still currently looking for a place. I am willing to do work and trying to get federal disability,” he said. “I still want to be a functioning member of society. I think I have a lot to teach other people and have a lot to give to the world.” Lindenwald is hoping a Go Fund Me page will be created to bring more awareness.

Jaime's son hit by glass after man attacks car,"LOS ANGELES: Actress-model Jaime King's four-year-old son was struck by glass after a man allegedly attacked a car the boy was in. On Wednesday, a man jumped on top of King's Mercedes-Benz and smashed the windows in while her son James Knight Newman was inside the car in Beverly Hills, reports eonline.com. According to the Beverly Hills Police Department, the shattered glass struck the child while he sat in the car's back seat. The ""Hart of Dixie"" actress, who is also mother to two-year-old Leo Thames Newman, was outside the vehicle at the time of the attack but a female friend was in the car with the boy and emerged from the car in order to protect James and was hit with a can by the attacker. The suspect, who has been identified as 47-year-old Paul Francis Floyd, was arrested for felony child endangerment, misdemeanour battery and two counts of felony vandalism. Floyd is being held on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear at the Airport Courthouse on Friday.

Trump's Tariff Threats Against China Spark Wide Criticism,"""These tariffs that have targeted China confirm that the Trump administration intends to bypass the WTO's dispute settlement body and unilaterally rely on U.S. law alone regarding the ongoing trade dispute with China. That is a big mistake,"" Jon R. Taylor, a political science professor at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas, said. WTO rules and regulations were established to provide a global mechanism to resolve trade disputes, he said. ""If the U.S. follows through on these tariffs, so will China,"" he warned. ""The ball is in the U.S. court."" Trump on April 5 threatened to slap tariffs on $100 billion of imports from China. It was the latest protectionist trade action against China. Earlier, the U.S. Trade Representative proposed to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of imports from China, which has drawn strong opposition from business groups. China on April 4 unveiled a list of products worth $50 billion imported from the United States that will be subject to higher tariffs and plans to take relevant U.S. practices to the WTO trade dispute settlement system. Canadian international business expert Ian Lee called the trade tensions between the United States and China more than bilateral--part of a broader issue involving Trump challenging the international trading system. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who called China a pillar of the multilateral system, said trade wars are always bad for those involved and for the international economy as a whole. ""We need to have international cooperation,"" he emphasized. The international framework that governs global trade is of extreme importance with the WTO at its center, he said, adding, ""Free trade is a very important contributor to global prosperity."" Guterres said wherever there is a problem, there must be dialogue and serious discussions to address it. ""I am a strong believer in multilateralism ... to address global problems... Global problems need to have global answers, and global answers can only be implemented through multilateral frameworks,"" he said. Martin Wansleben, Chief Executive of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, suggested direct talks among the parties involved to work on common trade rules within the WTO for maintaining a good and fair world trade. Imposing new tariffs is ""an economic dead end,"" he said. Growth and welfare are based on cooperation. ""The economies of China and the United States have been intertwined heavily for a long time, so it's impossible to introduce any protective trade measures without hurting the two economies or the world economy,"" Wansleben said.

Epicurean Santa Barbara Opens Culinary Possibilities,"“Wouldn’t it be cool if we did food events all the time?” Keith recalled thinking. “And not just for Newcomers,” continued Amy. So they took the Newcomers model of an annual membership ​— ​that money pays for administration, insurance, bookkeeping, marketing, supplies, and more ​— ​plus per-event fees and began plotting last summer along with Renee Martin and Leif Pietila, who’ve since taken more of a backseat. Help also came from advisory boardmembers Michelle Isom, Paul Astbury, and Jeremy Allen, a card-carrying oenophile who helps organize the wine events. The Epicurean offerings are much like what’s done in Newcomers, said Allen, “but seriously elevated.” Their gala launch at Sullivan Goss in November featured musicians planted amid the crowd, as Amy likes to foster the “immersive quality of the arts” and Keith sees food on the same plane as visual and performing arts. Without warning, as people mingled, a violinist and cellist started playing. “The next thing they know,” said Amy, “the person they’re speaking to is singing to them.” Said Allen, “Suddenly, the event becomes memorable.” Explained Keith, “We like to run progressive events, with a first act and a second act and a third act. It keeps people engaged.” At his stylish home with stunning Goleta-foothills-to-Carpinteria-coast views atop the Mesa, Allen recently hosted a tasting of Turtle Rock wines with vintner Don Burns, who also makes Saxum wines. Amy made excellent appetizers, and Burns spoke openly about his craft, answering questions both basic and probing with honesty and charm. By Matt Kettmann. The wines kept flowing, as did the conversation, and all attendees got to leave with a bottle of their choice, as the ticket price includes a bottle to go. And the club doesn’t ask winemakers to pour for free, as do many tasting events of this sort ​— ​they buy all the wines up-front, which winemakers like. (The Turtle Rock post-party dinner at Black Sheep, complete with Allen’s Sine Qua Non and Torbreck bottles, was even more winemaker bait.) “We’ve approached a dozen winemakers, and no one’s turned us down,” said Keith, whose list of wineries so far also includes Booker and L’Aventure. But aside from the wine and food, Epicurean Santa Barbara is about making connections between people who love good food and drink. “It truly is a club,” said Keith, who wants to grow the membership, currently around 100, to 300. “People become friends. They come from all walks of life. It’s a good mix.” Said Allen, “You want to bond with your tribe, and this facilitates that.” 4·1·1. Epicurean Santa Barbara memberships are $195 for an individual, $295 for individual VIP , $295 for a couple, and $445 for a couple VIP . Events range in price.

"Yes on Cuyahoga County Issue 9, renewal of 3.9-mill health and human services levy:...","MetroHealth Medical Center, the county hospital system, is one of the beneficiaries of the Health and Human Services levy. ( By Editorial Board Cuyahoga County's health and human services levies help young children attend high-quality preschool, provide treatment for the mentally ill and the drug-addicted and ensure that last-resort medical care is available to all in the county at MetroHealth Medical Center, among many other services. This year, Issue 9 , the smaller of the two levies, is on the May 8 ballot. It's an important 3.9-mill two-year renewal that will bring in $104 million annually. The levy, which will not raise taxes, costs the owner of a $100,000 home about $135 a year. This levy does so much that losing it would be ""catastrophic,"" Cuyahoga County Executive Armond Budish told the editorial board Tuesday. Two recent controversies do not reflect overall on the tremendous work the county does in human services. The first is the death of Aniya Day-Garrett , a four-year-old girl who was not removed from her home by county workers, who said they lacked evidence of abuse, a failure that is still under investigation. Aniya's mother and her mother's boyfriend have been charged with aggravated murder in the girl's death. Then there's the ongoing corruption investigation that has named several Cuyahoga County employees, none in the county's social services departments.

Tunisias reluctant NATO partnership,"By Umberto Profazio, Consulting Research Assistant for the IISS Armed Conflict Database On 12 February, Tunisian Defence Minister Abdelakrim Zbidi told a parliamentary committee his ministry had rejected a NATO grant of €3 million (US$3.7m) for the establishment of a joint command centre in Tunisia. The centre would have served to plan, command and control joint military operations by Tunisia’s armed forces, with a particular focus on border controls and the fight against terrorism. Considering Tunisia’s interest in security cooperation with NATO and the Alliance’s eagerness to support Tunisia’s young and democratic institutions, the revelation came as a surprise. Relations between NATO and Tunisia seemed solid and have improved considerably in recent years. In 2014, 20 years after joining the Mediterranean Dialogue programme, Tunisia entered a NATO individual partnership and cooperation programme focused on priority areas including counter-terrorism and border security, two core concerns of the Tunisian authorities. The following year former prime minister Habib Essid visited NATO headquarters in Brussels, discussing ways to deepen the partnership in areas of mutual interests including military education and training. Essid’s 2015 visit came amid a wave of terrorist attacks in Tunisia, which forced President Beji Caid Essebsi to declare the state of emergency still in force three years later. Since the Ben Guerdane attack in March 2016, security forces seemed to have gained the upper hand over jihadist groups, preventing infiltration attempts from neighbouring Libya and containing the terrorist insurgency in Mount Chaambi, Kasserine governorate. However, the country’s officials believe there are close to 3,000 Tunisian fighters in foreign war zones such as Iraq, Libya and Syria. Their eventual return home following the territorial collapse of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, will pose serious challenges to the country’s stability. Given Tunisia’s exceptional security challenges and the volatile regional context, the rejection of NATO’s offer raises questions about Tunisia’s willingness to enhance its partnership with the Alliance. Tunisian authorities seemed motivated by the need to preserve national sovereignty in security matters: during his committee appearance, Zbidi said NATO had demanded its staff have access to the joint command centre, which was expected to be established in Gabès. Tunisian authorities oppose the presence of any foreign organisations inside the country, and were wary of NATO’s interference in the choice of base location. US drone strikes cause embarrassment The command centre incident suggests Tunisia closely guards its sovereignty, and is particularly sensitive on issues such as security, border controls or counter-terrorism. But the authorities have often collaborated with foreign partners in recent years. In late 2016 Tunisia worked with the United States as the Government of National Accord in Libya launched Operation Solid Structure (Bunyan Marsous) . During efforts to oust ISIS from Sirte, the US gave air support to a coalition of militias from Misrata that formed the backbone of the operation. In October 2016, during the fiercest phase of the fighting, the Washington Post revealed that the US was conducting surveillance drone operations inside Libya from an airbase in Tunisia. The episode highlights Tunisia’s ambivalent attitude towards Western partners. US government officials confirmed the reports, saying Reaper drones were flown by US personnel with the consent of the Tunisian government, from an existing base run by the Tunisian army. However, the news deeply embarrassed authorities in Tunis: defence officials initially denied allowing the US to operate such drone flights from Tunisian airbases, only to be contradicted a month later by Essebsi, who confirmed that US drones were flying missions at the border with Libya, according to an agreement with Washington to share intelligence. The proclaimed (but often neglected) principle of Arab solidarity can help explain Tunisia’s ambiguity towards the 2016 US military operations, as well as the country’s reluctant partnership with NATO. The Tunisian government may find it uncomfortable to tell its people that their military bases are used by Western governments for operations in neighbouring countries, or that foreign militaries are present on their soil. This concern is evident in controversy surrounding a proposed intelligence fusion centre in Tunisia, announced by NATO in 2016. The centre would have involved military and civilian agencies sharing intelligence across different disciplines and focusing on the phenomenon of Tunisian foreign fighters. Its main purpose was supporting Tunisian Special Forces in counter-terrorism activities, deepening the cooperation between NATO and Tunis. However, Tunisian authorities denied such a centre would be created. The Ministry of Defence said the country already had an intelligence fusion centre financed by Tunisian institutions and managed by its own officials. Even though the press reported progress on this issue last year, saying that the project was near completion, no breakthrough has yet occurred. Cooperation with Algeria External factors also explain Tunisia’s reluctance to become deeply involved with NATO. Given the instability affecting North Africa since the Arab Spring, security cooperation with neighbouring countries has been unavoidable for the Tunisian government. Tunisia has strengthened its relations with Algeria, responding to the terrorist threat along the countries’ shared border. In 2014 the neighbours struck a deal to secure the border and share intelligence, and a security cooperation agreement was signed in March 2017. Algeria traditionally opposes any Western military presence in the region and has always been wary of the establishment of military bases in neighbouring countries. This stance, which clearly stems from the non-interventionist policy adopted by Algerian authorities since the nation’s independence, could have played a role in Tunisia’s recent decisions to decline NATO offers. Tunis is increasingly reliant on Algeria’s counter-terrorism expertise, gained during the ‘black decade’ of the 1990s. The arrival of NATO bases or officials in Tunisia could have upset Tunisia’s western neighbour, possibly harming crucial security cooperation. A greater role for France Another reason for Tunisia’s decisions may be found in France’s shifting approach to North Africa. Since his election in May 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron and his foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian have been promoting a new course in North Africa, making frequent visits and arranging meetings with the clear aim of allowing France to assume a central role in the region. In a visit to Tunis on 1 February Macron criticised NATO’s 2011 intervention in Libya, saying attempts to solve a crisis through unilateral military action were an obvious mistake. It is interesting to note that Macron’s remark anticipated Zbidi’s announcement on the NATO joint command centre. It is extremely unlikely that the visit of the French president affected Tunisia’s most recent decision. But the rejection of NATO’s grant offer seems to ease Paris’s quest for leadership in North Africa, allowing the French administration to take advantage of favourable circumstances, including visible US disinterest in the region.

Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich issued statements Thursday, taking aim at Scott Pruitt's policy decisions and questions about his conduct. ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Documents show a New Mexico GOP state lawmaker and congressional candidate failed to disclose that her real estate company earned nearly a half-million dollars in state contracts. An analysis of campaign financial disclosure records by The Associated Press found Rep. Yvette Herrell's company took in $440,000 by renting property to two state agencies since 2013. However, Herrell did not disclose that income on ethics disclosure statements. SAN DIEGO (AP) - The U.S. National Guard faces a vastly different environment than it did on its last two deployments to the border with Mexico, with far fewer illegal crossings and more Central Americans than Mexicans coming. Still, its role is shaping up much the same: moving more Border Patrol agents from behind-the-scenes jobs to the front lines. Federal law limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, creating a supporting role for the Guard. WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump has renewed his fierce denunciation of the nation's immigration policies. At an event in West Virginia, the president called for tougher border security while reviving his unsubstantiated claims that ""millions"" of people voted illegally in California.

InvestEU- European support for climate-related research by Kemira Oyj,"The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed a USD 49.3 million (EUR 40 m) loan with global chemicals company Kemira Oyj, headquartered in Finland. The loan was made possible by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the central pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, which was launched by the EIB Group and the European Commission to boost the competitiveness of the European economy. Kemira will use the financing to boost its investments in research, development and innovation in chemical applications and technical solutions for water treatment, pulp and paper chemicals, and other chemicals. The aim of the project is to develop new products and technologies for the pulp and paper industry, municipal and industrial waste-water treatment as well as the mining industry. The R&D programme will be implemented in Kemira’s existing R&D centre located in Espoo, Finland, where highly specialised jobs will be maintained through the programme. Vice-President Alexander Stubb, responsible for EIB-lending in Northern Europe, said: “Everyone knows that natural resources are limited and that we have to make optimal use of them. The research, development and innovation programme proposed by Kemira will enable industries that use a lot of water to implement more circular economy-focused models, thus mitigating climate change.” European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, responsible for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness, said: ""The €40 million loan signed today by the European Investment Bank under the Investment Plan for Europe demonstrates both the EU's and Kemira's commitment to investing in the circular economy and minimising waste generation, as well as delivering growth and job opportunities. With this EU-backed financing, Kemira's R&D capabilities are reinforced to develop new products and methods for treating waste water and to research innovative solutions for example in the paper and pulp as well as mining industries."" Supporting projects like Kemira, is part of the European drive to promoting a circular economy, where the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy for as long as possible, and the generation of waste is minimised - a key EU policy priority. The EIB, together with the European Commission, supports the Member States in their transition towards a circular economy by providing finance and advisory services for such projects. During the last five years the EIB has co-financed EUR 2.4 billion of circular economy projects with a positive impact on sustainable and economic growth, competitiveness and employment around Europe and beyond.","['Finland', 'Kemira', 'Espoo', 'States']","[63.2467777, 60.9061532, 60.2047672, None]","[25.9209164, 26.6486543, 24.6568435, None]"
Cerar and Erjavec say Slovenia’s reaction was appropriate. Janša: We’ve fallen out with everyone,"At a session of the parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee, the outgoing PM Miro Cerar and Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec stressed that Slovenia’s action in the Skripal affair was appropriate. The president of the SDS Party, Janez Janša, said that Slovenia had fallen out of favour with both Russia and Great Britain. Outgoing PM Cerar said the incident is not being investigated only by Great Britain and its intelligence services, but the intelligence services of other countries as well. He added that all of them had come to similar conclusions. ""The cross analysis shows that Russia is most likely responsible for the attack and that there are no convincing alternative explanations,"" Cerar said during a debate with Luka Mesec from the Left party. Mr. Mesec pointed out that the situation is similar to that in 2003, when Slovenia endorsed the invasion on Iraq, even though it was later proved that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons for mass destruction. Cerar stressed that the statement of EU leaders does not represent a legal decision, but a political declaration. 'This was a political discussion and a political decision was formulated in these conclusions,' he explained. Cerar said that Slovenia had to endorse the statement and show its solidarity with all the EU member states. By recalling its ambassador to Moscow for consultations, Slovenia made a less radical diplomatic step. Cerar reminded the committee that such a measure was also taken by Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia. 'In this case, Slovenia did not blindly follow the EU, NATO and other countries. This was also demonstrated by our decision, which is different from the majority of EU states, but nevertheless aims for the same goal,' stressed PM Miro Cerar. No conclusions by the committee Janez Janša from the opposition SDS party said that Slovenia, with its actions, has fallen out of favour with both sides . ""Slovenia acted more Catholic than the Pope would expect,"" he said, and added that Slovenia is a specific case in the EU and NATO because of its relations with Russia. Both Cerar and Erjavec rejected Janša’s assessment that anyone held any resentment towards Slovenia. Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec reminded of the fact that the European Union adopted the same measure, by recalling its ambassador to Russia for consultations. According to the minister, Slovenia’s action represented its own interests, as well as those of the EU and NATO. Ernest Petrič, an advisor to President Borur Pahor, supported the government’s decision in recalling Slovenia’s ambassador to Russia for consultations. According to Petrič, by doing so, Slovenia had sent a message that it disagreed with such actions and expressed solidarity with its allies. ""It would’ve been a cardinal mistake if we didn’t do anything. It would’ve pushed us to the edge of an area which is based on common values,"" he warned. Slovenia’s Ambassador to Russia, Primož Šeliga, was also at the session but did not participate in the debate. After the session, Erjavec said the ambassador was recalled for consultations for an indefinite period. The minister said that it will still have to be decided when the ambassador returns to Moscow. After debating for three hours the a half the committee failed to arrive at any conclusions. The chair of the committee, Jožef Horvat, only read a statement that the committee got acquainted with the government’s position on the expulsion of Russian diplomats.","['Slovenia', 'Russia', 'Great Britain', 'Iraq', 'Moscow', 'Bulgaria', 'Luxembourg', 'Malta', 'Portugal']","[46.1199444, 64.6863136, 54.3151594, 33.0955793, 55.7505412, 42.6073975, 49.8158683, 35.8885993, 39.6621648]","[14.8153333, 97.7453061, -1.9181532, 44.1749775, 37.6174782, 25.4856617, 6.1296751, 14.4476911, -8.1353519]"
"Fishers, swimmers warned to stay out of the sea over water quality concerns","The Water Corporation is warning people not to swim, dive, kayak or fish within one kilometre of a wastewater outlet off the coast of Cape Peron in Rockingham. Testing of water near the outlet, four kilometres from the shore, has been showing elevated microbiology levels since mid-February. More than 150 dead mullet, along with some jellyfish, washed up on the Safety Bay foreshore on March 28, but they were too decomposed to determine if there was a link. A Water Corporation spokeswoman attributed the rise in microbiology levels to recent works associated with a major upgrade of the Woodman Point Wastewater Treatment Plant. The outlet has fed into a 20-metre deep channel running parallel to the shore since 1984. Between 1991 and 1994 a Water Corporation study was conducted to determine the effects of nitrogen in the wastewater. It found the effects of ocean disposal at the Point Peron outlet to be minor and not ecologically detrimental. Wastewater in WA is diluted through physical and chemical processes to make it lighter and lower in density, so it rises and mixes with seawater to minimise the environmental impact. However the Water Corporation said part of a $158 million upgrade to the Woodman Point facility had affected the efficiency of this. The project is expected to completed by October 2019, but the work which is having an impact on the water quality is due to be completed before May. Water Corporation was undertaking further testing to determine with more certainty when the water will become safe again. It has apologised for any inconvenience caused to users of the ocean in the area.

Police say Bassett approached Beedle in the alley and stabbed him in the back. Beedle stumbled out of the alley and collapsed at the corner of State and Hubbard streets, police said. He was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. After the stabbing, Bassett ran away into the nearby Red Line subway platform at Grand and State where he waved the knife at two women in the stairwell, police allege. The women, 21 and 26, told police Bassett threatened to stab them. Bassett was arrested on Wednesday around 10:20 a.m. after he was “positively identified” as the person who killed Beedle, police said in a press release.

1) Special Report: 30 years since murder of Athens family of 5 - Part III,"WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) -- It took hundreds of reports, countless hours and two costly trials for investigators to close the case involving the murders of five family members. But it's not a murder conviction keeping the suspect in prison. October 1989, following a month -long trial, Chris Jacobs is found not guilty of killing five people. A huge disappointment to the prosecution and law enforcement who had already spent countless hours working to get justice in the deaths of Helen, Clarence, Irene, Marie and Randy Kunz. But to the public's surprise in 1993, prosecutors file a new charge against Jacobs-- kidnapping and false imprisonment of Helen Kunz just before the statute of limitations runs out. “I think this had kind of fallen off the radar,” recalled former NewsChannel 7 reporter Bill Holland. “And the initial reaction from a number of people was 'Can they do that'?” Holland covered the case for a number of years while working at NewsChannel 7 from 1986 to 1998. Investigators said the new charge comes after a former girlfriend of Chris Jacobs said he confessed to the murders. But the defense says she's in legal trouble in Minnesota and is just hoping to make a deal. It would take another five years for the trial to begin thanks to a number of motions and a federal appeal. But in June 1998, Jacobs is back before a jury again-- this time-- in Saint Croix County due to pre-trial publicity. “This trial is about Helen Kunz's suffering. Her being held against her will. Her being abducted. And possibly being raped,” said Marathon County Assistant District Attorney LaMont Jacobson during opening statements. The prosecution begins by addressing the Kunzs lifestyle. “You may find find them repulsive. You will hear of a house filled with pornography. You will hear of a house that was filthy. You will hear rumors of incest. But you will hear that they never hurt anyone,” Jacobson said. The defense suggested it was Helen Kunz that killed her family and then committed suicide. But after eight days, and four hours of deliberations, a jury disagreed. “We the jury find the defendant Chris Jacobs III guilty... “ “Somebody asked the prosecutor if he was happy with the outcome, and his response was 'No one is happy. Five people are dead, a young man is going to prison,” Holland recalled of the trial's outcome. Chris Jacobs was sentenced to 31 years in prison that August. Jacobs withdrew from parole consideration in February 2006 and never had a parole hearing. A spokesman from the Department of Corrections said Jacobs is scheduled to be released in February 2020. He'll remain on extended supervision until 2029. Kenneth Kunz, the surviving member of the Kunz family and the person that found the bodies of his relatives, died in 2001. He was 68. We asked the current Marathon County Sheriff if he considers this case closed-- even though no one has ever been convicted of the Kunzs' murders. He said 'yes', the department is confident the right man is in prison today. Because Chris Jacobs had been acquitted in the homicide case, he could not be retried with homicide as it would be double jeopardy.","['Wis.', 'Holland', 'Minnesota', 'Saint Croix County', 'Marathon County']","[44.4308975, 52.2434979, 45.9896587, 45.0312388, 44.8914036]","[-89.6884637, 5.6343227, -94.6113288, -92.4679305, -89.7748098]"
U.S. urges Ukraine to abolish requirement for anti-graft activists to declare assets,"U.S. urges Ukraine to abolish requirement for anti-graft activists to declare assets. 922 Politics Ukraine's asset declaration system should hold public officials accountable and not place unnecessary burdens or pressure on civil society. Spokesperson for the U.S. Department Heather Nauert says the United States urges the Ukrainian government to repeal legislation that requires the asset declarations from civil society and international members of state-owned-enterprise supervisory boards. ""The United States strongly encourages the government of Ukraine to repeal legislation that requires the asset declarations from civil society and international members of state-owned-enterprise supervisory boards,"" reads the statement published on the State Department website on March 30. ""Ukraine's asset declaration system should hold public officials accountable and not place unnecessary burdens or pressure on civil society. This punitive law targets those very individuals who seek to increase transparency and accountability in Ukraine, fulfilling the promises of the Euromaidan and the Ukrainian people's aspirations for a democratic country governed by the rule of law,"" Nauert said. ""We urge the Ukrainian government to expeditiously cancel the asset declaration requirements, in line with recommendations by the Venice Commission, and, in the interim, provide a temporary amnesty for those individuals who do not file declarations by the upcoming deadline,"" she added. As UNIAN reported earlier, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on March 27, 2017, enacted the No. 6172 law on amendments to Article 3 of the Ukrainian Law on Prevention of Corruption, introducing e-declaration for non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The law sparked harsh criticism on the part of civil society in Ukraine as well as the U.S. and EU. A number of foreign partners called it a ""step back"". The Venice Commission stated that the requirements for the anti-corruption activists to submit e-declarations of assets should be completely removed from the relevant law or significantly narrowed. On March 21, 2018, the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Prevention and Combating Corruption recommended that the parliament adopt bills proposing to postpone the provision of e-declarations by civil activists. On March 22, the parliament refused to consider said bills. On March 28, 2018, Poroshenko called on the Verkhovna Rada to repeal the legislative requirement for civil activists to submit asset declarations. Verkhovna Rada Chairman Andriy Parubiy proposed to adopt the relevant legislative amendments on April 3.","['U.S.', 'Ukraine', 'the United States', 'The United States']","[48.6840558, 49.4871968, 47.8281626, 47.8281626]","[9.0096574, 31.2718321, -122.598365, -122.598365]"

Zimbabwe:British Airways Rejects Plea for London-Harare Route,"By Staff Reporter. The Herald Tourism minister Prisca Mupfumira recently approached British Airways (BA) regarding the possibility of direct flights between London and Harare but was turned down by the UK flag carrier, it has emerged. According to Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) chief executive Karikoga Kaseke, BA was concerned that the route does not, presently, have enough business class potential to complement the undoubted economy class possibilities. Although actual numbers remain unclear, there is a significant Zimbabwean diaspora in the UK and many regularly travel back home to visit with their families. However, it would appear that BA reckons much of that traffic is largely economy class and, therefore, not commercially viable. Britain used to be a key source market for Zimbabwe's tourism industry, but visitor numbers collapsed after relations between Harare and London suffered a Siberian chill at the turn of the millennium. However, with the UK-bashing Robert Mugabe toppled by a military revolt last year and with London apparently taking a shine to the new Emmerson Mnangagwa administration, Zimbabwe tourism authorities sense an opportunity to get back into the graces of the lucrative British market. Hence the approach to BA because the perennially struggling Air Zimbabwe appears incompetent at the task despite numerous vows to resume service after abandoning the route years ago due to mounting debts and the seizure of its aircraft. ZTA boss Kaseke confirmed the BA approach at the recent Zimndaba investment conference which was held in London when he was asked about direct flights between the two countries. ""Last time when my minister was here, she had a meeting with British Airways,"" he said. ""BA are saying that, from their perspective and when they look at their projections, they see a lot of potential for economy class travellers but when they look at business class possibilities and try to balance with their business model they are seeing the balance not working out. ""They (BA) say they are more interested in the business class travellers. As you know, KLM introduced flights some few years back and within nine months they pulled out for the same reasons."" He continued; ""In terms of fuel, when airlines are flying they fly for business; they want to get money, it's not for charity. ""When the profitability of a route is looked at from a yield point of view - the mixture of business and economy class passengers - it must show a positive sign and BA are saying at the moment, they don't see the positive from the business class travellers."" Kaseke said they are however continuing to engage BA and convince them that business class travel will follow the establishment of direct connections. The improvement of political relations between the two countries might also positively impact investment and trade which could lead to an increase in business class travel. ""They (BA) are working with us now; we are trying to convince them what starts first. Is it an egg or the chicken? To us, there is no doubt, the chicken starts,"" said Kaseke. ""The chicken must be there to lay the eggs and we are saying once you put a flight, we can then develop the route to the extent that they then get the passengers that they require. ""So, this chicken and egg situation they are telling us - we are saying there is no chicken and egg situation in flights. The chicken is the flight that must lay the eggs. We are still talking with BA."" The ZTA boss was however scathing about Air Zimbabwe. ""On air Zimbabwe, that is a million-dollar question. We don't know what is happening with Air Zimbabwe. We don't have anyone to talk to at Air Zimbabwe. There is always some acting persons (CEOs) who say I don't know what the government is doing. ""I knew this question was going to be raised, so, I talked to the acting CEO of Air Zim and he said he doesn't know. So, what is he doing there? He said I don't know what you are talking about, I don't know when we are going to have this flight to London and he is just seated there, and he is just a caretaker. ""So, Air Zimbabwe is a big problem; we don't know what is going on, but BA gave us these indications when my minister went to see them at their head office. ""This is the situation, we want to see direct flights between Harare and the UK; that is a must. I don't know when (it will happen), but I think we are trying to talk to other airlines and I'm sure we will see direct flights between the UK and Zimbabwe.""","['London', 'UK', 'Britain', 'Zimbabwe', 'Zimndaba']","[51.5074456, 54.7023545, 54.3151594, -18.4554963, None]","[-0.1277653, -3.2765753, -1.9181532, 29.7468414, None]"
Italian band's live rig and one-of-a-kind instruments stolen in Gothenburg,"An Italian metal band has been forced to cancel the rest of its European tour after thieves broke into their van in Sweden and stole the full live production rig, including one-of-a-kind custom instruments and stage props. Fleshgod Apocalypse played a show in Gothenburg on April 2nd then parked their tour van outside the hotel they were staying in near the ferry port before retiring for the night. In the morning they discovered their van had been broken into and much of the contents stolen, putting them thousands of euros out of pocket. ""They stole all of our guitars, our electronic equipment and wireless systems, some drum parts, stage props, a lights console and spare parts. We don't have an exact estimation yet, but it's something around 15-20,000 euros worth,"" piano player Francesco Ferrini told The Local. The group has released a list of the stolen items and asked musicians to keep an eye out for them in case they appear for sale in the coming weeks. Their guitars are particularly special as they are custom built. ""They're unique, custom-made instruments. They're decorated with two 'F' symbols like violins and are very easy to recognize. No one else in the world uses them,"" Ferrini said. The band's stolen bass. Photo: Fleshgod Apocalypse. The band was due to play further shows in Copenhagen, Hamburg, Brasoc and Mannheim this month but has instead returned home due to the theft, which was reported to police in Sweden. Their endorsers are working to replace the instruments as soon as possible, but the Italian group was not so lucky with the electronics, which were not covered by endorsements.

Canadians to start getting emergency alerts on their cellphones,"Starting today, Canadians won't have to be near a television or radio to receive emergency alerts. Life-threatening emergencies will now be broadcast on compatible mobile phones. As of today, the National Public Alerting System - commonly called Alert Ready - will include wireless networks, in addition to traditional broadcast channels. In the case of a life-threatening emergency, officials will send a localized alert that will compel compatible phones to emit an alarm and display a bilingual text warning. Situations that could prompt an alert include forest fires, terrorist threats or an Amber Alert for a missing child. Canada's broadcast regulator, the CRTC, has said that wireless carriers will conduct one test of the system during the week of May 6.

Ahn Young-Joon-Pool-Getty Images,"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) - A South Korean court has found former President Park Geun-hye guilty on multiple counts of abuse of power, bribery and coercion and sentenced her to 24 years in prison. Park's conviction brings to close a corruption scandal which gripped South Korea, upending the country's politics and implicating some of the country's most powerful figures. ""The President abused the power which was given to her by the citizens,"" the judge said, adding a tough sentence was needed to send a firm message to the country's future leaders. Prosecutors had asked for Park to receive a 30 year sentence. Park was found guilty of 16 of the 18 charges she faced, related to a massive influence-peddling case that removed her from office last year. As well as the prison sentence she was also fined $17 million. The former president was not in the Seoul Central District Court to hear the verdict. Park and her lawyers refused to participate after the court decided to live broadcast the judgment, the first time this has happened in South Korea, after a law was passed last year to enable it. Park lawyer's are expected to appeal her sentence. Outside the court, hundreds of supporters of Park had gathered to watch the verdict on a large screen, waving Korean and US flags and calling for the former president's release. Older, conservative South Koreans, who remembered the dictatorship of Park's father fondly as a period of strength for the country, were her electoral base and a common sight throughout the impeachment process. Dramatic downfall. South Korea's first female president, and the daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee, Park Geun-hye was arrested in March 2017 shortly after she was stripped of her office by the country's Constitutional Court, which upheld a parliamentary vote to impeach her. That vote came after millions of South Koreans took to the streets over a period of several months to demand Park's ouster, after revelations of the alleged massive influence wielded by her adviser and confidant, Choi Soon-sil. Choi, the daughter of a cult leader once accused of having ""complete control over Park's body and soul during her formative years,"" held no political office but is accused of using her influence over the President to funnel money to organizations she controlled and get her daughter a place at an elite university. Park was accused of being unduly influenced by Choi. The court which upheld her impeachment agreed with accusations that Park had abused her authority in helping Choi raise donations from companies for foundations she had set up. In February, Choi was sentenced to 20 years in jail on 18 charges including abuse of power, coercion, fraud and bribe, and fined $16.6 million. Also implicated in the scandal was Samsung chief Lee Jae-yong. The 49-year-old billionaire was found guilty of bribery and other corruption charges last year and sentenced to five years in prison, but in February a higher court reduced his sentence and suspended it for four years.

SKorean baseball league postpones games over pollution,"South Korea's rapidly worsening air pollution has forced the country's professional baseball league to postpone three games. The Korea Baseball Organization on Friday postponed the games in capital Seoul and the nearby cities of Suwon and Incheon after the government issued alerts over high fine dust levels in the metropolitan area. It's the first time the league postponed games because of air pollution since the country began pro baseball in 1982. A KBO official said the games will be rescheduled later in the season. She didn't want to be named, citing office rules. As of 5:30 p.m. Friday, the fine dust concentration level was measured at 377 micrograms per cubic meter near Seoul's Jamsil Stadium, where the Doosan Bears had been scheduled to host the NC Dinos before the game was postponed. South Korea issues an advisory when the fine dust level reaches 150 micrograms per cubic meter and a warning if the level exceeds 300 micrograms per cubic meter. South Korea in recent years has been experiencing an acute rise in air pollution that experts link to emission from the country's increasing number of cars and also to China's massive industrial activity. In a meeting with top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi last week, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said China was partially responsible for South Korea's pollution problem and called for Beijing's cooperation in Seoul's efforts to improve air quality.","[""South Korea's"", 'Seoul', 'Suwon', 'South Korea', 'China', 'Beijing']","[36.9643355, 37.5666791, 37.2633325, 36.638392, 35.000074, 39.9057136]","[126.9984173, 126.9782914, 127.0287472, 127.6961188, 104.999927, 116.3912972]"
2018 BTCC preview: 8 things to watch for this season,"The 2018 British Touring Car Championship gets going tomorrow at Brands Hatch, where reigning champion Ashley Sutton will be out to defend his title. Before the 32-car field bumper bangs its way into Paddock Hill Bend, we run through eight key things to look out for in what is almost certainly going to be another fantastic season of racing. No more surprises from Ashley Sutton. Few predicted Sutton would storm to last year’s title in just his second season in the BTCC and his first in a Team BMR Subaru Levorg . This year, Sutton goes into the season as the driver to beat – a very different pressure. The BMR squad has slimmed down to three cars this year, with former champion Jason Plato returning. He’ll be aiming to bounce back after a tough season in which he scored just one race win. The BMW squad. Sutton’s closest rival in 2017 was Colin Turkington, who headed the manufacturers’ title-winning line-up of WSR BMW . The double champion is back in an unchanged trio alongside 2012 champ Andrew Jordan and multiple race winner Rob Collard. Ingram expectations. Tom Ingram was another 2017 surprise package, winning four races in his family-run Speedworks Toyota Avensis . While quick, he struggled with consistency; if the team can find it, he could be a dark horse. The Porsche invasion. Double Porsche Carrera Cup champ Dan Cammish has landed a plum drive in a Team Dynamics Honda Civic Type R (pictured) as Gordon Shedden’s replacement, and he isn’t the only 911 racer making the switch. Stephen Jelley, a double BTCC race winner, is back after two years in the Carrera Cup. He’ll drive a Team Parker Racing BMW. New Focus for Ford. Having split with long-time driver Mat Jackson, the Motorbase Ford Focus squad will run proven race winners Tom Chilton, Sam Tordoff and James Cole this year, giving the Kent-based outfit three drivers capable of fighting at the front of the pack. Double the drama. To mark the BTCC’s 60th season, the third race at Snetterton on 29 July will be a 60-mile ‘Diamond Double’. There will be no success ballast, it will have a stand-alone qualifying session and double points will be on offer. Alfa attack. The Alfa Romeo badge is back on the grid, with Rob Austin running a HMS Racing-prepared Giulietta.

China warns Trump: We’ll fight US ‘at any cost’ on trade,"By JILL COLVIN and GILLIAN WONG, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — China vowed on Friday to fight the U.S. ""at any cost"" after President Donald Trump proposed slapping an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods in an escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. Trump's surprise move Thursday to instruct the U.S. trade representative to consider the additional tariffs came a day after Beijing announced plans to tax $50 billion in American products, including soybeans and small aircraft, in response to a U.S. move this week to slap tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports. In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China doesn't want a trade war — but isn't afraid to fight one. ""China will dedicate itself to the end and at any cost and will definitely fight back firmly"" if the U.S. persists in its ""protectionism,"" the ministry said in a statement. Trump's proposal intensified what was already shaping up to be the biggest trade battle since World War II. Global financial markets had fallen sharply as the world's two biggest economies squared off over Beijing's aggressive trade tactics. They calmed down Wednesday and Thursday on hopes the U.S. and China would find a diplomatic solution but slid Friday after Beijing said it would fight the Trump administration's latest threats. The White House announced after the markets closed Thursday that Trump had instructed the Office of the United States Trade Representative to consider whether $100 billion of additional tariffs would be appropriate and, if so, to identify which products they should apply to. He's also instructed his secretary of agriculture ""to implement a plan to protect our farmers and agricultural interests."" ""China's illicit trade practices — ignored for years by Washington — have destroyed thousands of American factories and millions of American jobs,"" Trump said in a statement announcing the decision. The latest escalation comes after the U.S. on Tuesday said it would impose 25 percent duties on $50 billion of imports from China, and China quickly retaliated by listing $50 billion of products that it could hit with its own 25 percent tariffs. The Chinese list Wednesday included soybeans, the biggest U.S. export to China, and aircraft up to 45 tons (41 metric tons) in weight. Also on the list were American beef, whiskey, passenger vehicles and industrial chemicals. Earlier in the week, Beijing announced separate import duties on $3 billion of U.S. goods in response to the Trump administration's duties on all steel and aluminum imports, including from China. U.S. officials have sought to downplay the threat of a broader trade dispute, saying a negotiated outcome is still possible. But economists warn that the tit-for-tat moves bear the hallmarks of a classic trade rift that could escalate. And already, the tensions have rattled global stock markets. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called China's move ""unjustified"" and said Trump's proposal was an ""appropriate response to China's recent threat of new tariffs."" ""Such measures would undoubtedly cause further harm to American workers, farmers, and businesses,"" he said in a statement. ""Under these circumstances, the President is right to ask for additional appropriate action to obtain the elimination of the unfair acts, policies, and practices identified in USTR's report."" China's Commerce Ministry said it must ""adopt new countermeasures"" to protect the interests of the Chinese people — but it did not announce any specific measures. The clash reflects the tension between Trump's promises to narrow a U.S. trade deficit with China that stood at $375.2 billion in goods last year and China's ruling Communist Party's development ambitions. Trump says China's trade practices have caused American factories to close and lead to the loss of American jobs. Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said earlier Thursday in an interview with Fox Business Network that negotiations were ongoing. But, he said, ""at the end of the day, China's unfair and illegal trading actions are damaging to economic growth, for the U.S., for China and for the rest of the world."" He also called Trump ""the first guy with a backbone in decades ... to actually go after it. Not just whisper it, but to go after it with at least preliminary actions."" One trade policy expert said he doubted that Trump's rhetoric would help forge any deal with China. ""Mr. Trump is upping the ante, but the lack of a clear game plan and an incoherent messaging strategy from the administration is setting this up for an all-out trade war rather than a fruitful negotiation,"" said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. In China, some observers held out hope that the two countries were headed toward negotiations and noted that despite Beijing's tough talk, it likely does not want the country's export-driven economy to be hit by punishing tariffs. ""If the trade dispute escalates or lasts for a long time, it will have a big impact on China's manufacturing industry, and foreign investment in related projects will be affected too,"" said Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based independent political commentator. ""In the long-run, losses in manufacturing will lead to decrease in tax revenue and eventually affect China's economic growth."" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic, called the escalation ""the dumbest possible way"" to punish China. ""Hopefully the President is just blowing off steam again but, if he's even half-serious, this is nuts,"" Sasse said in a statement. ""Let's absolutely take on Chinese bad behavior, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us."" Any additional tariffs would be subject to a public comment process and would not go into effect until that process is complete. Wong reported from Beijing.

Murdoch's Star bags India cricket media rights for record $944m,"India's cricket board Thursday struck a record $944 million deal with broadcast giant Star India for the media rights of the national team, adding to their substantial television wealth. The amount was 60 percent higher than the last sale for the rights to India's national teams and domestic tournaments. Rupert Murdoch's Star beat rival bidders including Sony and Reliance Jio to win the television and digital rights for 2018-2023, the Board of Control for cricket in India said. The BCCI said in a Twitter statement that international and domestic rights had been sold for 61.38 billion rupees ($944 million). BCCI treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary said on Twitter that the sum was the equivalent of more than 60 million rupees ($935,000) per match included in the deal. Star paid 38.5 billion rupees ($592 million) for the broadcast rights to India's home matches for 2012-2018. Star also paid a massive $2.55 billion last year for the media rights to the BCCI's lucrative Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament. That five year deal also starts from 2018. ""It was a hat-trick (by Star), beginning with the IPL broadcast and then the production and finally the home broadcast for five years also,"" Chaudhary told reporters in Mumbai. ""If we compare the figures for IPL broadcast rights and the current one, then the IPL figure per match - for 300 matches - was 54.49 million rupees ($845,000) and this figure is far ahead than that, for the 102 matches."" The first internet rights auction in cricket - with each rival having a unique log on for bidding - lasted for three days before Star placed its winning bid. Initially six companies, including Facebook and Google, entered the fray to bid for international and domestic matches in India from April 15, 2018 to March 31, 2023.","['India', 'Mumbai']","[22.3511148, 19.0815772]","[78.6677428, 72.8866275]"

South Africa's ex-President Zuma in court on corruption charges 21 Mins South Africa's ex-President Jacob Zuma appeared in a Durban court Friday to face multiple corruption charges relating to a billion-dollar arms,"DURBAN, South Africa (CNN) - South Africa's ex-President Jacob Zuma appeared in a Durban court Friday to face multiple corruption charges relating to a billion-dollar arms deal in the late 1990s. It's a dramatic U-turn for Zuma, who just weeks ago held the highest office in the land. He resigned on February 14, forced out by the leadership of the ruling African National Congress, his own party. Thousands of people turned out to support Zuma as he arrived at the high court for his first hearing. They had been asked not to wear ANC colors, but many wore wraps and T-shirts with the former president's image. Some supporters sang as Zuma entered the courtroom. He turned, smiling, to acknowledge them. The former President is charged with 16 counts of corruption, money laundering and racketeering, stemming from the billion-dollar government arms deal. He is accused of receiving 783 questionable payments in connection with the deal. Zuma, who has always said he wanted his day in court, denies any wrongdoing. After a brief preliminary hearing, the judge adjourned court proceedings to June 8. Despite its brevity, the hearing was notable in a continent where leaders -- former or current -- don't generally face the law. Andrew Feinstein, a former ANC member of parliament, has long accused Zuma of corruption. ""But the question is, can Zuma keep himself out of court using legal machinations?"" he asked. Up until his Durban court appearance, Zuma's legal team had been successful in doing just that with a series of mostly procedural maneuvers. In court Friday, his defense team said it would challenge the decision to prosecute. Slew of scandals. The arms deal controversy clouded Zuma's reputation for decades, even before a slew of other scandals rocked his presidency. In 2005, Zuma's former financial adviser Schabir Shaik was convicted for ""overwhelming evidence"" of corruption and found guilty of organizing multiple payments to Zuma to help facilitate and protect an arms deal with a French arms company. In 2009, the charges against Zuma were dropped just before he ascended to the presidency. They were reinstated after years of legal wrangling. ""On one level, Zuma has just run out of legal options, but there has also been a political change and it is unfortunate that that political change has meant that the National Prosecuting Authority is doing what it should have done all along,"" said advocate James Grant, a former professor of law at Witwatersrand University. A high-stakes fight. Legal experts believe the trial, should it go ahead, could take years. The prosecution against Zuma is being led by Billy Downer, the experienced advocate who successfully prosecuted Shaik. But criminal advocates such as Mannie Witz, who has defended everyone from gangsters to soccer stars for four decades, said the state would have its work cut out for it. Taxpayers have spent millions footing the bill for some of South Africa's top legal minds working on Zuma's defense. ""They understand the game and they are going to give it their all,"" said Witz. ""I think they are in for a proper fight. This is going to be a 15-rounder -- this is like a heavyweight competition,"" he said. Witz says that no matter what, the law now needs to take its course. ""You want to show that everybody is equal before the law and everybody is entitled to his day in court and it doesn't make a difference if you are the president or ex-president of the country,"" he said.

Spark still there for diamond duo,"A retired electrician says the spark in his marriage still exists as the happy couple celebrate their diamond wedding anniversary this week. Barry Smith, 80, and Beryl, 81, met as young teenagers on a coach on their way back from a holiday in Blackpool in 1953 with their families. Barry, who was from Dewsbury said: “She had beautiful black curly hair, that’s what attracted me, I think I did all the chasing. “We went on our first date to the Pioneer cinema in Dewsbury.” The pair were engaged in 1956 and married at South Ossett Church on April 5, 1958, before heading on their honeymoon to Great Yarmouth. Their first home together was a rented back-to-back cottage in Dewsbury, which Barry said cost a wage-draining 75 pence a fortnight. They moved to Thornhill, before switching to Middlestown, and then finally their bungalow in Overton where they have spent the last 24 years. Barry worked as an electrician for most of his life, owning SB Smith Electrical on Middletown’s New Road between 1966 and 1984, while Beryl worked as a trouser machinist in Earlsheaton. They had four children, including two boys and two girls, and now have five grandchildren and one great grandchild. Despite retiring, and with plenty of grandchildren to spoil, they both still enjoy going to the theatre, gardening, and even DIY. They also spend time in the sun with their daughter in Portugal The pair will celebrate with around 40 family and friends for a meal. And the secret to their long-lasting marriage?

JJ McNamara invited to Dublin International Piano Competition,"Chances are, if you grew up in a house where there was too much music around you all day long, you'd get fed up of it fairly quick. Not so with JJ McNamara. The young pianist, who has just launched a debut CD of music, was immersed in it from a young age, as a son of RTE music director and Late Late Show pianist, Frank McNamara, who runs a recording studio at the family home at Rathbeggan, near Dunshaughlin. The 18 year-old is now studying at the Guildhall School of Music in London, with legendary English pianist, Martin Roscoe, and has been selected as one of only six Irish pianists selected to take part in the Dublin International Piano Competition next month. “I've recorded 400 or 500 CDs, but this one was the most enjoyable I've worked on,” his father, Frank, said at the launch of the CD, simply and aptly called 'Debut', at Dublin venue No 25, Fitzwilliam Place. “It was a great pleasure and something I'll never forget.” JJ and his father paid tribute to his teachers, Gogoshka Kinkladze, Padhraic O’Cuinneagain and Jonathan Middleton. “I get very hard to teach my own,” Frank laughs. JJ, who started piano at four, explains he used the Kickstarter' method to raise money for the album and help towards his studies in London, and is very appreciative of all who made donations. He was awarded a scholarship to London Guildhall School. “I'm only a few months over there, and it's great. You get a lot of time to spend practicising, as it is all geared very much towards being a performer.” His mother, former RTE presenter Theresa Lowe, adds that when JJ calls home, he loves to play new pieces over the phone to them. “When I haven't heard him for three or four weeks, I can hear the improvement,” Frank McNamara says. The 'Debut' CD certainly demonstrates the talents of the young piano player, with music by Haydn, Chopin, Liszt, Debussy and the hugely challenging 2nd Piano Sonata by Sergei Rachmaninov. Born into a very musical family, whenhe was 11, JJ toured Ireland with his parents and siblings on the McNamara family tour, playing 13 venues in which he performed some Beethoven and Chopin. In 2011 at the age of 12 in the Newpark Music Festival, he received the highest ever mark of 97 in the Concerto Cup and was the youngest ever winner of the award for his performance of Grieg’s Piano Concerto (1st movt). Since then JJ has won first prize in many national piano competitions, most notably in April 2014, when he was awarded first prize in The Junior Piano Concerto Competition in the Feis Ceoil performing Shostakovich Piano Concerto No 2, 3rd movement (with Frank on second piano) and multiple prize winner at Sligo Feis, Piano Academy National Music festival and Arklow Feis for the second year in a row. In April 2015, JJ performed the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 live on the John Murray Show RTE Radio 1 and followed it up with his debut at the Convention Centre, Dublin with a solo lunch-time concert for the Dublin International Video Games Festival, performing Liszt, Beethoven and Chopin. Two days later, JJ was a soloist on the main stage in the Video Games Live Concert performing his own arrangement of video game themes in a mash up with Mephisto waltz, Wilde Jagd and the Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 by Liszt. He was delighted to be selected by Barry Douglas for the young musicians programme at the Clandeboye Festival in 2015 and in 2016, was awarded the World Piano Teachers special prize at the Junior Chopin International Competition in Poland. Also in 2016, JJ won his first International Competition - Masters of the Sonata - an online competition for his performance of Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Sonata. In March of this year, he won the GCSE online series for performance of a piece by Haydn, and in April at the Feis Ceoil in Dublin, JJ was awarded the Betty Clarke medal for his repertoire performance and performed at the prizewinners’ gala concert at the National Concert Hall. Also in April, he was a finalist and prizewinner in the International Spanish Piano Competition, Xabia Concurso. In October, JJ was invited by the National Symphony Orchestra of Moldova to perform as soloist in Tchaikovsky’s 1st piano concerto in a live radio and television broadcast to 76 countries.

The Rs have lost just once in their last six Championship games,"Ian Holloway believes Queens Park Rangers have finally found consistency heading into this weekend’s game against The Rs find themselves sitting pretty in midtable, safe from relegation but out of the promotion picture after a somewhat patchy season. However, with very little on the line, they seem to have found a winning formula that has seen them pick up three wins over the last five games, a run they will be looking to extend this weekend at the KCOM Stadium. Holloway has altered his formation, favouring four at the back rather than five and it seems to have galvanised his side, convincingly beating Sunderland and Aston Villa before holding Fulham to a draw at Craven Cottage. A 1-0 defeat to Reading could have seen their season hit the buffers on Good Friday, but instead they responded in fabulous fashion to sweep Norwich City aside 4-1 on Easter Monday, ensuring they will arrive in East Yorkshire riding a wave of confidence. Read More As such, Holloway believes QPR can continue their recent good form this weekend and carry on building. “We have moved away from the five and gone to a back four which gives me the opportunity to put another forward in and I feel the lads are ready for that now,” Holloway told the club website. “People might say why didn't I do that earlier on? Well I didn’t have everybody ready then! We had injuries and the young lads, who are improving game by game, still needed some time. But they have become more and more confident because we have moved other people on and started to back them.

We are getting more of our own identity. “It’s all about getting the right feel. I was so pleased with the fourth goal against Norwich the other day because at 3-1 if you let one in you can go back into the shell and lose a bit of confidence, but after the fourth, we played with belief and moved the ball in the way that I wanted them to. “The spirit is really good and I am really pleased with them at the moment.” Like us on Facebook; Follow us on Twitter; Daily Newsletter.","['Sunderland', 'Norwich City', 'East Yorkshire']","[54.9058512, 52.6348426, 38.5680312]","[-1.3828727, 1.2871862, -90.3257566]"
Cadillac President Says New Biturbo V8 Won't Go To Corvette,"Cadillac’s new biturbocharged V8 is a brutal thing – at least on paper. Under the hood of the new CT6 V-Sport, the 4.2-liter turbo units produces a whopping 550 horsepower (410 kilowatts) and 627 pound-feet (850 Newton-meters) of torque. That type of performance, paired with the fact that it will be built at GM’s Bowling Green, Kentucky facility, would lead us to believe that the engine could make its way to a , right? Not so fast. According to Autoblog Corvette , it’s unlikely that the same engine will find its way underhood of any other GM product anytime soon. In an interview Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen at the New York Auto Show , he immediately shot down rumors of the biturbocharged V8 making its way to any car other than the CT6 – specifically the upcoming mid-engined Corvette. ""Just quit the speculation it's headed for Corvette,"" said de Nysschen bluntly. ""It's not."" The engine has more of a focus on refinement than performance, said de Nysschen. Features like variable-valve timing and direct injection, as well as cylinder deactivation and stop-start make it one of the most advanced engines the company has ever built – and they’re betting big on it. ""It's a matter of being a thoroughbred luxury car,"" said the CEO. ""It's really only a luxury brand that could recoup this [development] cost."" While the mid-engined Corvette may not have Caddie’s biturbocharged V8 under the hood, we know that the super coupe will come with plenty of power. Rumors suggest that we could see a 5.5-liter V8 with as much as 850 hp (633 kW), or a modified version of the 4.2-liter V8 with a pair of turbos that could produce somewhere in the neighborhood of 650 hp (484 kW).

Delhi High Court seeks response from Pranab Mukherjee on plea against his book,"The plaintiffs' advocates had claimed before the trial court that a civil suit can be filed against the President during his tenure in respect of any act done by him in his ""personal capacity"". NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court today sought response of former President Pranab Mukherjee on a suit seeking deletion of some references to the 1992 demolition of in Ayodhya from his 2016 book on the grounds that they have hurt sentiments. Hindu Justice Pratibha M Singh issued notice to Mukherjee on the plea by a social worker and a group of lawyers against his book 'Turbulent Years 1980-1996'. The matter was listed for further hearing on July 30. The court in September last year had called for the trial court records of the suit after the plaintiffs (the social worker and the lawyers) moved an appeal against the lower court's order of November 30, 2016 rejecting their plea to delete certain portions of the book of the then President Mukherjee. Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, appearing for the plaintiffs, had argued that the lower court wrongly dismissed the suit on the grounds that there was no cause of action. He had earlier contended before the high court that there was cause of action when the book was published on January 28, 2016 and also after September 5, 2016, when the two-month notice issued by the plaintiffs for deletion of portions of the book had expired.

"Council approves renaming Third street after the late opposition icon, Morgan Tsvangirai","By Talent Gondo | Harare’s Third Street will soon be renamed after the late Movement for Democratic Change founder and President, Morgan Richard Tsvangirai. Harare Mayor, Bernard Manyenyeni confirmed the development saying the renaming of Third street was a council resolution from yesterday’s full council meeting. Manyenyeni however said, while council had endorsed the proposal, the process of renaming Third Street after Tsvangirai would have to go through cabinet. “Yes, council resolved to rename Third Street after the late Tsvangirai,” said Manyenyeni. He however said the resolution would soon be tabled before cabinet for approval before it is implemented. “It has to go through cabinet and that is due process,” said Manyenyeni. Following the death of the opposition icon on February 14 2018, councillors within the MDC T dominated Harare City Council began tabling the proposal to name one of the streets in the central business district (CBD) after their late leader. Tsvangirai, succumbed to colon cancer aged 65. The late opposition leader is credited for changing the face of Zimbabwean politics after winning against former President, Robert Mugabe in the 2008 harmonised elections. Rugare councillor, Peter Moyo moved the motion to have one of the roads named after Tsvangirai during a full council meeting in March 2018. Moyo argued that since the late opposition leader had not been accorded hero’s status by the Zanu Pf led government, there was need to rename one of the streets in the CBD after Tsvangirai as a way of honouring and remembering his contribution towards democracy in Zimbabwe.",['Zimbabwe'],[-18.4554963],[29.7468414]
Incoming MFSA chairman accuses Deutsche Bank of being ‘among most well-known channels of money laundering’,"Incoming Malta Financial Services Authority chairman professor John Mamo has accused Deutsche Bank of being a well-known “money-laundering channel”. Mamo was answering questions put to him by MPs on the new parliamentary committee established to vet appointments to government agencies and regulatory bodies, where he was asked about the threat posed by tax harmonisation to Malta’s financial services. He said that the UK’s departure from the European Union meant Malta had lost a valuable ally, but insisted that Malta needed to stand its ground in the face of pressure by other European member states. “Germany has been one of the most vociferous countries but it doesn’t exactly have a clean banking history because Deutsche Bank is one of the most well-known channels of money laundering,” said Mamo. He added that the same could be said for London. “We need to make it clear that we are keeping a clean house but as I am saying, we also don’t need to be masochistic and do more than those attacking us are doing.” Despite the need for Malta to defend itself, Mamo said it also needed to understand that in some occasions, “retreat was sometimes the best form of defence”, especially when dealing with countries like the UK, which can leverage the use of correspondent banks. Mamo was the first appointment to be scrutinised by the new committee set up at the end of last year. His nomination was announced in December, with both the Labour and Nationalist parties agreeing to his appointment. Asked how Malta could improve its competitiveness, Mamo stressed the need for the country’s educational system to produce more qualified individuals that could take on the top jobs in the sector. Above all, he stressed the importance of quality, reputation and seriousness for Malta to compete. He said this was especially true if it intended to enter the crypto-currency and blockchain industries. “These sectors are very specialised and there is a lot of debate on where they will go,” he said. “I understand that we want to be the first to regulate, but we will have to see the extent to which the industry will be allowed to operate out of Malta.” MPs from both sides of the House said they were satisfied with the written replies provided to the committee by Mamo however Opposition MP Carm Mifsud Bonnici noted that there were concerns about the MFSA’s current situation, especially as it related to Pilatus Bank and the country’s reputation. He said the Opposition understood the situation with the bank was still a developing one, but stressed that it believed more measures could have been taken. Mamo replies by saying he knew as much as the layman about the case at this stage. “I have been following it closely and up until this morning there was a full page in Financial Times.” He said he agreed it was a very big problem but couldn’t say whether the MFSA acted correctly or not because he simply didn’t know, but added there were a number of areas in which operations could be improved. “It appears that communications department is weak and I know there are efforts to recruit more people,” he said. Moreover, he pointed out issues related to confidentiality, explaining that it was often very difficult to determine “where the line should be drawn”, even when it came to communication between different units within the MFSA. He ensuring smoother operations was one of his priorities, but added that he was also mindful of the fact that the regulator was sometimes criticised unfairly. “I don’t think the MFSA is above criticism but I would like to see this criticism being levelled at it for something it actually did or didn’t do.”","['Malta', 'UK', 'Germany', 'London']","[35.8885993, 54.7023545, 51.1638175, 51.5074456]","[14.4476911, -3.2765753, 10.4478313, -0.1277653]"

A question of diversity: how fashion is ditching ...,"""We want to be held accountable,"" she said in a recent interview. ""We didn't recognise that in this new age of transparency,"" she added, ""what the brand stands for is super important to people."" Fast fashion companies, which specialise in low-priced, quickly produced clothing and have grown faster than the apparel industry as a whole for years, are under pressure to be more prolific and provocative as they sell across more borders. H&M, which added 479 stores last year, now has more than 4000 stores in dozens of countries. Inditex, the enormous parent company behind Zara, has more than 7500 stores in 94 countries. Zara outsources a small fraction of its designs – just 2 per cent of the 20,000 designs it produces each year – and all are sent through multiple reviews before being offered for sale. But some of the outsourced designs have proved problematic. When fashion is contracted out, ""there's a lot less control, a lot less oversight and involvement from the company along every step of the process"", said Felipe Caro, a business professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has spent years studying Zara. Last year, critics complained that images of frogs on a Zara skirt resembled a cartoon character called Pepe, which was designated a hate symbol of the alt-right by the Anti-Defamation League. The skirt was designed by an independent Spanish artist, Mario de Santiago, who is based in London. In a statement at the time, he said that the frogs had ""no connection at all with anything related to hate, violence or discrimination"". Ricardo Cavolo, another artist who designed for the same collection, said in an email that the design process ""was pretty fast"". He spent two days at Zara's headquarters in Spain, creating paintings on denim that the company then reproduced without making any changes, he said. Supply chain experts recommend more careful, decentralised vetting procedures that send designs through a central checkpoint at headquarters and also past gatekeepers in the country of sale. Soon after shifting into her new role at H&M, Wu said she visited South Africa, where the importance of soliciting local input quickly became clear. ""I thought I was very culturally aware,"" said Wu, who was born in Taiwan, grew up in New York and speaks Mandarin. ""I learned so much more just by being in that office."" A few months ago, during a long day spent styling and photographing products for H&M's website, no one on the Stockholm set appeared to raise concerns about one more item to process, the hoodie with the offensive message, according to a person familiar with the shoot. Critics said the garment might have been flagged if H&M's team was more diverse. ""It's so easy to avoid this kind of controversy,"" said Angel Sinclair, the founder of the advocacy group Models of Diversity. ""If you care about being culturally sensitive, just be more culturally inclusive of talent and managers in the business."" H&M has more than 100,000 workers worldwide. But the fashion giant's board is entirely white. And retail experts said that much of the creative process takes place in and around its European home office, far from many of its markets. Fast fashion has produced tone-deaf products for years, passing them off as a rounding error given the enormous volume of items the companies generate each year. But more shoppers have begun calling on retailers to take a stand on social and political issues, such as sexism and gun control. ""These incidents are happening in a climate where marginalised communities are feeling more targeted, more under attack, so they're more in tune with these issues,"" said Melissa Garlick, a lawyer with the Anti-Defamation League. ""Fashion companies have a responsibility to the public and to consumers to ensure that they're being sensitive in designing and marketing products – they have to be aware of what lines not to cross."" Several companies have pledged to diversify hiring, retool corporate guidelines and initiate other measures to prevent mistakes from going out the door. Zara now uses an algorithm created to scan designs for insensitive or offensive features. In 2016, it hired a committee of diversity officers. Diversity and inclusion training has become mandatory for all new employees.
